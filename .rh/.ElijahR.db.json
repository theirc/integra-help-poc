Distribution in Integra via Expense Journal","Path::contents/CIK_Distribution_in_Integra_via_Expense_Journal.htm::InnerText":"\n  CIK Distribution Overview\n  Contribution-in-Kind (CIK) are non-cash donations made to IRC such as, supplies, vehicles, equipment, and services.\n  CIK distributions are recorded in IRC’s books using project ID CK001 or specific “CK” project IDs assigned for “Other CIK” such as Airbnb credits, Uber, Lyft, and LDS.\n  \n    It is important to confirm requirements for recording use of donated goods/services with the team member responsible for the grant to ensure the correct project is being assigned.\n  \n  Distributions of CIK (Contribution-in-kind) goods are processed using one of two methods in Integra:\n  \n    Via Inventory Management module – used by CRRD and RAI for distributing CIK products that are tracked in inventory, e.g., large LDS donation items.\n    Via expense journal – used by RAI offices for distributing CIK goods/services that are not tracked in inventory and are only tracked at point of distribution. E.g., storefront items, AirBnB credits, etc.\n  \n  Note: This guide outlines the Expense Journal method. For instructions on distributing CIK items using the Inventory Management transaction, refer to the Inventory Management training user guide.\n  CIK Volunteer/Pro-bono Hours\n  The tracking and calculation of volunteer hours or pro-bono services remains the same outside of Integra; however, rather than sending your information to Finance, Volunteer Coordinators (or their equivalent role in any office) will complete an expense journal to record the sum of volunteer hours. It is up to the office to decide on the frequency of this journal (e.g., weekly, monthly, etc).\n  Process Flow Diagram\n    ‎\n  \n  Record CIK Distribution in Integra\n  Note: Some steps may vary from office to office.\n  \n    CIK Distributor completes distribution of items, records detail (outside of system) to match donor requirements and obtains client signature.\n    After client interaction is complete, CIK Distributor enters information obtained on paper copy into an expense journal in Integra.\n  \n  \n    If item level detail is not required in supporting documents, the expense journal can be entered ahead of time and printed as a receipt to be signed\n  \n  \n    CIK Distributor scans signed paper copy and attaches it to expense journal in Integra.\n  \n  \n    This must be done in a timely manner as it is required before Finance can post the expense journal to the GL.\n    The document must be attached at the overall journal level, not the voucher line level.\n  \n  \n    Finance reviews the expense journal for accuracy and completion and ensures the signed copy is attached to the journal in Integra.\n    Finance posts the journal to the General Ledger.\n    System transfers information back to ETO and updates the relevant client records.\n  \n  Single-line vs. Multi-line Expense Journal\n  If all items being distributed to a client support the same set of financial dimensions they can be entered as one line in the journal – a summary line. The distribution details are contained in the paperwork that gets attached to the journal.\n  Example: If a client comes into the CIK shop and picks up five different items that can be attributed to one client, for one program, only one journal line is required as the financial dimensions will be the same for all five items.\n  Alternatively, there could be five different journal lines entered into one journal with each line having its own unique D-codes.\n  Example: Multiple lines would be required if one client belongs to multiple programs and products are being distributed to more than one of the client’s programs.\n  Create an Expense Journal to Record Distribution of CIK Products to a Client or Record Volunteer Hours\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to record the distribution of CIK product(s)* to a client and/or record volunteer hours.\n  Important: Ensure you attach the signed receipt at the journal batch level, not on the individual journal voucher lines.\n  *The term product above can refer to both goods and services.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    Required project categories have been set up in the system\n    CIK Distributor knows all the financial dimensions required to complete the expense journal. This includes the D1 (Project ID) and D9 (Client ID).\n  \n  ‎\n  Steps\n  \n    Log in to Integra and ensure the correct legal entity is selected in the top right corner.\n    From the module navigation pane on the left, navigate to Project management and accounting > Journals > Expense.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the menu at the top of page, click New.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the Name field, click the drop-down and select PROJ_CIK from the selection list.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the Description field, overwrite the default description with meaningful text for ease of searching. E.g., CIK + Client name. (Important: This text becomes the identifier in ETO when the transaction is transferred from Integra.)\n  \n  For volunteer hours, make the description as clear as possible to allow Finance and other users (including yourself) to be able to identify immediately what the journal holds.\n  \n  \n    On the menu directly above the table grid, click the Financial dimensions tab.\n  \n  \n  \n    Complete the header financial dimension fields indicated in the table below:\n  \n  Important Notes: \n  \n    This is the header entry page for any financial dimension values. Any values entered here are automatically applied to all lines in the journal.

It serves as a communication/prompt to the Finance team to revise the budget in a timely manner.  \n          All functionality is still available on the project with this status.  \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Liquidation\n        \n        \n          This status is manually applied when project is in liquidation phase.\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Closed\n        \n        \n          This stage is manually applied by HQ when project is officially complete.

The example below highlights the naming convention relative to the project ID/D1.\n  \n  The two types of sub-projects get created in Integra as outlined below:\n  \n    A subaward sub-project D1 extension code is created centrally in OTIS and automatically flows to Integra via the OTIS/Integra interface.\n      \n        A D1 extension is required for all subaward su-projects, regardless of the subaward budget value\n      \n    \n    A non-subaward sub-project D1 extension code is created manually in the relevant Integra reporting entity.\n  \n  IMPORTANT: As Integra only allows one naming convention, Finance teams must ensure the description of the sub-project clearly distinguishes between an organization name and a field site or program sector.\n  Developing Donor Asset Budget Lines\n  All fixed assets that are expensed to a project must be assigned a project category that is linked to a “Donor Asset Group”. This is done during project setup when project categories are either assigned (standard categories) or are created (unique categories). The process achieves the same objective and assigns a donor asset group to a specific project category. However, the steps to assign the donor asset group differs for the Unique Category Project Budget Development Template and the Standard Category Budget Development Template.\n  Unique Category Project Budget Development Template: This template is mainly used in CRRD where donor reporting formats are determined by the donor. If there are project budget lines set up to procure donor assets in the project budget, the Unique Categories Project Budget Development Template automatically assigns the “Donor Asset Group” in the Project Category worksheet when the following main accounts are entered into the Data Source tab.\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Main Account\n        \n        \n          Main Account Description\n        \n        \n          Asset Group\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          74101\n        \n        \n          <$5K IT Equipment\n        \n        \n          DITUNDR5K\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          74102\n        \n        \n          <$5K Other Equipment\n        \n        \n          DOTUNDR5K\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          74103\n        \n        \n          >=$5K Equipment & Furniture\n        \n        \n          DEQFOVER5K\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          74130\n        \n        \n          Vehicles Purchase\n        \n        \n          DVEHICLES\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          85000\n        \n        \n          CIK Asset (Non-Depreciable)\n        \n        \n          CIKASSETNO\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  The project categories tagged with the “Donor Asset Group” (from table above) will be uploaded into Integra. The relevant project category is selected at the time of procuring the asset and the asset tag (from the Asset Group table above) on the project category will flow through to the purchase order.\n  Once the asset has been received and the product receipt has been recorded in Integra, the system will automatically create the asset record in the Fixed Assets module and will assign a penny value to the asset.\n    ‎\n  Roles and Responsibilities Matrix (HQ and CRRD)\n  Roles and Responsibilities Matrix (RAI and OFR)\n  \n  Using the Budget Template\n  \n    The Budget Development Template is a standardized template used to develop and amend project budgets.\n    Two different budget development templates have been designed to accommodate the following types of projects. Ensure the correct template is used!\n      \n    \n  \n  1. Standard Project Category Budget Template\n  - Used for projects that use standard project categorie\n  2. Unique Project Category Budget Template \n  - Used for projects that use unique project categories\n  \n    All unrestricted projects use standard project categories\n    Temporary restricted may use either standard or unique project categories; this is based on the reporting needs of each specific project.\n    Restricted projects may use unique or standard project categories. Examples of when each would primarily be used are listed below.\n      \n        US Gov – use standard project categories\n        European (ECHO funding) - use unique project categories\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    The budget templates contain numerous queries and formulas that streamline the population of the project files that get generated and uploaded to Integra. \n  \n  \n    Be sure to read ALL the information on the Instructions sheet in the Budget Template.

This process is defined as intercompany accounting. The intercompany accounting process ensures that on a regular monthly basis, expenditures paid by one office on behalf of another office are booked to the correct Integra reporting entity/SUN database.\n  Until deployment of Integra to all offices is complete, there are two processes that will be followed: 1. End-state solution and 2. Interim solution.\n  End-state solution\n  The Integra solution for Intercompany Accounting was developed to achieve the following:\n  \n    Streamline the intercompany process\n    Remove the need for too many staff members being involved in the process\n    Take advantage of Integra’s ability to allow a user with the correct security access to post directly to a different Integra legal entity.\n  \n  The role responsible* for the executing office must always move the intercompany entry from the general ledger (GL) to the appropriate project (D1) in the Projects module (subledger). \n  * (local office CRRD Deputy Director Finance; RAI Finance Manager)\n  This movement entry is necessary because posting these entries to the general ledger does not mean the entries automatically flow into the Projects module. If the entries remained in the general ledger the project budget balances in the Projects module would be incorrect. This would then have an impact on revenue recognition.\n  As part of moving these transactions from the GL to the project, there is a requirement to ensure the correct project category (D2) and other financial dimensions have been coded in the original entry as there is no ability for one legal entity to charge another legal entity’s project module through the intercompany journal.\n   \n  End-state Business Process Flow\n  \n  Interim Solution\n  Until IRC completes deployment of Integra to all offices, there is an interim period where some offices are using Integra and some offices are still using SUN.\n  During this transitional state, there is a requirement to post entries into multiple databases in Integra.\n  The databases involved in intercompany accounting are:\n  \n    9IRC - the Integra reporting entity for HQ; it is where all the HQ and regional unit budgets are set up and it is the reporting entity where HQ staff transact daily.\n    ICCO - the Integra database that HQ and any office on Integra will post into for all entries paid for on behalf of another office that will need to be reflected in that office’s SUN database.\n  \n  The postings to ICCO are converted into an output file with a format compatible with SUN Systems. This file is the equivalent of today’s HQ ZHQ File.\n    ‎Local Finance staff will continue to upload this file into their SUN database on a monthly basis.\n  \n    ISUN - the Integra database that HQ will use to post all local SUN final monthly SAF files.‎The SAF files will be converted into a format compatible with Integra and mapped to financial dimensions in Integra.\n  \n  Finance staff will continue to re-code their intercompany entries received by adding the T1, T2 codes and any other necessary T codes when they receive their intercompany entries via their ZHQ file and re-code to the appropriate T1.\n  Interim-state Business Process Flow\n  \n  Key Messages for Intercompany Accounting with Integra\n  \n    Both the interim and end-state solutions require intercompany postings to be re-coded to the relevant projects.\n    When the executing office is on Integra, but the requesting office is not, the executing office must post to the interim reporting entity ICCO.\n  \n  ICCO is only used when the executing office is on Integra and the receiving office is still using SUN.\n  \n    When the executing office is still using SUN and the requesting office is using Integra, the executing office codes transactions to their balance sheet under main account 29300 or 29400, per current process.\n    When both offices are on Integra, the posting is done directly between the two reporting entity codes in Integra; there is no need to post to ICCO or ISUN.\n    Reporting entities do not have access to each other’s sub-ledgers, therefore, intercompany transactions must be posted to the requesting office’s GL.\n  \n  The requesting office must then reverse the charge from their GL and post it to the relevant sub-ledger, e.g., Project management and accounting module.\n  IRC’s Intercompany Transactions\n  Outlined below are the various types of intercompany transactions that may be processed.\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            From/To Office\n          \n          \n            Details\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Interim State (used when one or more of the companies are not yet using Integra)\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            HQ to SUN Office\n          \n          \n            HQ is paying for something on behalf of another office who is still on SUN.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            SUN office to HQ\n          \n          \n            An office that is still on SUN is paying for something on behalf of HQ.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Integra office to SUN office\n          \n          \n            A non-HQ office that is on Integra is paying on behalf of another office who is still on SUN.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            SUN office to Integra office\n          \n          \n            An office that is still on SUN is paying for something on behalf of a non-HQ office that is on Integra.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            SUN office to SUN office\n          \n          \n            An office that is still on SUN is paying for something on behalf of another office that is still on SUN.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            End State (used when both companies are using Integra)\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Integra office to Integra office\n          \n          \n            One legal entity on Integra is paying for something on behalf of another legal entity on Integra.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Example: HQ purchases and pays for goods on behalf of the Atlanta office. HQ uses the intercompany journal to post the expenditure to Atlanta’s GL. (Remember, they cannot charge it to a sub-ledger. Atlanta must then reverse it out of their GL and post it to their sub-ledger (typically to projects). There may be some instances where Atlanta will not need to reverse the amount to a sub-ledger, e.g., prepayments, as they always sit in the GL.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Process Intercompany Transaction in Integra\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to process an intercompany transaction in Integra.

The system calculates the value for this column and updates it automatically.\n    Note: If the number is less than the expected on-hand, the Quantity column displays a negative value. If the counted quantity is greater than the on-hand quantity, the Quantity field displays a positive value.\n    Discrepancy in Counted Values\n    If there is a discrepancy between the on-hand and counted values, best practice is to perform a second count. The second count is a manual process and happens outside of the system and is not performed by the same person who did the original count. The warehouse personnel submits the second counted values to the supervisor. The supervisor enters the second count value in the Counted column, and this is the final count.\n    In the Worker column, for each item counted, enter the personnel number for staff who performed the count.\n    Note: Click the drop-down and search for the individual using their name. Click  and their personnel number populates the Worker field.\n    \n    Click  when all the Counted values are entered.\n    \n    Click .\n    \n    Review the info-message the counting journal validated successfully.\n    Click  on the toolbar at the top of page.\n    Result\n    You have recorded the counting results in Integra.\n    If there were discrepancies, you accounted for these and performed and entered a second count.\n    The counting results can now be posted.\n      ‎\n    Post Counting Results\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to post the counting results.\n    Prerequisites \n    Physical count of items has been recorded in Integra.\n    Steps \n    From the Integra Home page, navigate the modules to Inventory management  Journal entries  Item counting  Counting.\n    \n    In the list, select the desired inventory journal by clicking the journal number.\n    \n    Click  on the menu at the top of the page.\n    \n    Click .\n     \n    Select from the following:\n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              If\n            \n            \n              Then\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              The journal posted\n            \n            \n              Review the info-message the counting journal posted successfully.\n              Click X to close the counting journal.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              You receive the following error message,\n              \n            \n            \n              1.Review the error message details.\n              2. For each item in the counting journal with a counting discrepancy, scroll down to the Line details and update the D1, D4 and D5 financial dimensions.\n              3. Click .\n              4. Proceed to the next procedure Adjust an Inventory Reservation to Process an Inventory Adjustment to reserve or unreserve quantities for each item in the counting journal with a counting discrepancy.\n              5. When the reservations procedure is complete, return here to step 3 in this transaction to post the counting journal.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n     \n    Review the info-message the counting journal posted successfully.\n    Result\n    You have posted the counting results.\n      ‎\n    Adjust an Inventory Reservation to Process an Inventory Adjustment\n    Purpose\n    Inventory is reserved to a project. To adjust the inventory balance of a stocked item, it must first be unreserved for a negative (-) discrepancy or reserved for a positive (+) discrepancy.\n    Use this procedure to unreserve an item with a negative (-) discrepancy or reserve an item with a positive (+) discrepancy from the project it is reserved to.\n    Prerequisites\n    You received an error message in an inventory adjustment transaction such as:\n    \n    Steps\n    Open a duplicate session of Integra.\n    Navigate the modules to Project management and accounting  Projects  All projects.\n    \n    On the All projects grid, in the Filter field, enter the project ID to search for the project the item is associated to.\n    Click  to the left of the line to select the project.\n    \n    On the menu at the top, click the Plan tab.\n    Under the Item requirements section, click Item requirements.\n    \n    Right-click in the column heading and select Insert columns…. to add the Location column to the display.\n    Tip: Click   Save so you do not have to add this column each time.\n    \n    Scroll through the list and click  to the left of Location – Inventory dimensions.\n    Click .\n    Note: Adding the Location column enables you to view the specific location the inventory should be unreserved/reserved from. It is added on the far-right of the display as the last column.\n    \n    Option: For easier reference, click the Location column heading and drag it to the right of the Item number column.\n    In the list of item requirements, locate the item number, location, and requested receipt date for the item to unreserve/ reserve.\n    \n    Click  to the left of the item to unreserve/reserve.\n    On the Manage tab, click   Reservation.\n    \n    Click the Reservation field and update the value.\n    Note: To unreserve an item with a negative (-) discrepancy, update the quantity by reducing it by the number of items to be adjusted.\n    For example, in the annual cycle count, the counted value is 139.00 but the value in the on-hand column is 140.00, reduce the reservation value by 1 to 139.00.\n    Note: To reserve an item with a positive (+) discrepancy, update the quantity by increasing it by the number of items to be adjusted after the counting journal is posted.\n    For example, in the annual cycle count, the counted value is 141.00 but the value in the on-hand column is 140.00, increase the reservation value by 1 to 141.00.\n    Once the value is updated in the Reservation field, the unreserve/reserve process is complete.\n    Note: This process does not require a validate or save.\n    Click X to close the Reservation form and return to the Item requirements grid.\n    Return to or proceed to the inventory adjustment transaction in which you received the inventory error message.\n    Result\n    You have unreserved / reserved quantity of an item reserved to a project.\n    Create Counting Journal – End-of-Grant Count\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to create a new counting journal for an end-of-grant inventory count in Integra.\n    This process is very similar to the counting journal process for the annual count but some of the criteria is changed for the end-of-grant count.\n    Prerequisites\n    n/a\n    Steps \n    From the Integra Home page, navigate modules to Inventory management  Journal entries  Item counting  Counting.\n    \n    Click on the toolbar at the top of the page.\n    \n    Complete/select the following fields/buttons:\n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Field / Button\n            \n            \n              Entry/Selection Required\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Overview Section\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Description\n            \n            \n              The description field defaults from the last description entered.\n              Update the description to a meaningful identifier for this counting journal.

It also facilitates postings between different modules (sub ledgers), and between the general ledger and modules, within the same legal entity.\n  \n    To/from different sub-ledger/modules\n    To/from general ledger\n    To general ledger from sub-ledger/modules\n    To sub-ledger/modules from general ledger\n  \n  General Rule: Use the DynAd Template if there are more than 10 journal entries that need to be uploaded, otherwise, create journal entries directly in Integra.\n  The table below provides a comprehensive list of different from/to posting scenarios available using the DynAd Template:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Module/Account\n          \n          \n            Module/Offset Account\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Ledger\n          \n          \n            Vendor\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Ledger\n          \n          \n            Bank\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Ledger\n          \n          \n            Ledger\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Project\n          \n          \n            Ledger\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Project\n          \n          \n            Vendor\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Customer\n          \n          \n            Bank\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Fixed Assets\n          \n          \n            Ledger\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Bank\n          \n          \n            Bank\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Project\n          \n          \n            Bank\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Bank\n          \n          \n            Vendor\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Customer\n          \n          \n            Customer\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Project\n          \n          \n            Customer\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Project\n          \n          \n            Project\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Vendor\n          \n          \n            Vendor\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  There are two different templates available to accommodate different currencies:\n  \n    DynAd Journal Template (used for USD/Base currency transactions)\n    DynAd Journal Template Other Amount (used for all non-USD currency transactions)\n  \n  The difference between the two templates above is that there are two additional columns in the non-USD/Base version to account for the exchange rate type and the exchange rate used.\n  Processing Foreign Currency Journal Entries\n  On Import from the DynAd Template:\n  \n    The transaction date determines which exchange rate to use, if re-classifying an entry from/to the current period.\n    The amount in transaction currency is converted using the Integra rate and posted to the base/accounting currency amount field.\n    Make sure the exchange rate is entered as a factor of 100. For example, an exchange rate entered as 1.1463 will be translated to 114.63 in the upload journal.\n  \n  Additionally, currency clearing between currencies can also be done using the DynAd journal. This is often the case for cash receipt accounts for funds sent from HQ but received in local currency.\n  Create a Journal Entry in Integra\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to create a journal entry directly in Integra.\n  This procedure may be used to post journal entries related to payroll, intercompany, accruals, prepaid allocations, advances, shared program cost allocations, vendors, customers, and re-classification entries.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    Journal type is known (refer to the Journal Types in Integra document for a full list of journal types and usage)\n    Financial dimensions are known\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    Navigate modules to General ledger > Journal entries > General journals.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the menu at the top, click New.\n  \n  \n  \n    A row is added at the top of the table.

Otherwise, leave it at 100.\n    In the Employee code field type the employee D7 code. This is only required if you are adjusting transactions related to personnel.\n    In the Reason code field, select the corresponding code for your adjustment.\n    In the Reason comment field, you can override the default entry and type additional comments for the adjustment.\n    Click OK.\n  \n  \n  You will see a split screen showing the transactions that you are adjusting at the bottom.\n  \n  At the top of those transactions that you want to adjust, you can verify the financial dimensions. The financial dimensions will be automatically populated based on the previous coding. Therefore, you can modify the financial dimensions accordingly for each line.\n  \n    Click Post on the menu at the top of page.\n    Click OK in the window that opens.\n  \n  \n  Result\n  You have recoded a GL entry.\n  Reverse a General Ledger Entry (After Trial Balance)\n  Use this procedure to reverse a general ledger (GL) entry in Integra.\n  Reversals can be used to reverse wrong entries in the GL and to later code them correctly.\n  Steps\n  \n    After running the trial balance (see above), double-click the transaction in the Closing balance column that needs to be reversed.\n    Click Reverse transaction.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the Transaction reversal screen, enter the Reversal posting date.\n    Click OK.\n  \n  \n  A message appears that the transaction has been reversed.\n  \n    Click Reversed tracing. The original and reversed transactions are displayed.\n  \n  IMPORTANT: Only general ledger transactions can be reversed. Any transaction that was posted from a sub-ledger cannot be reversed in the General Ledger.\n  \n    Close the transaction by selecting X at the top right of the screen when the review is completed.\n  \n  Result\n  The GL transaction has been reversed.\n  \n  \n  Populate the DynAd Template\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to populate the DynAd Template to upload mass transactions into various modules of Integra.\n  Steps\n  \n    Retrieve the most up-to-date version of the DynAd Template from Box.\n    Carefully read all the following instructions embedded in the DynAd Template itself.\n  \n  \n    Field-specific instructions in the header section of the template\n    Column-specific instructions for each journal entry line\n  \n  \n    Populate the Dynad Template with journal entries.\n  \n   \n  Important: Do not change any information in any of the column headers of the DynAd Template.

This project adjustment has been customized to include reason codes and the user can trace these adjustments back to the original project transaction. The DynAd Journal does not have this ability.\n  For re-classification of amounts from one balance sheet account to another, and for intercompany booking and re-coding, the DynAd Journal is used.\n  When re-coding project EXPENSE and FEE charges, the DynAd Journal can also be used.\n  If you are re-classifying a foreign currency transaction within the same accounting period, then you do not need to 'force' the exchange rate.\n  Re-classification of Prior Period Entries (Interim Period)\n  During the interim period, the process for re-classification of prior month entries will adhere to the following:\n  \n    All prior period date entries, whether they are re-classification or intercompany clearing transactions, are posted with the current month system date in Integra.  \n    The Document date field is used to track original date of the transactions.  For entries originating from a prior period but that were either posted originally or re-classified using the current period system date, the document date field must be populated to include the original transaction date.\n    The SAF file from the country office shall be uploaded to ISUN with the transaction date and document date.\n    If the transaction date of the SAF file entry is within the current month, the system transaction date and the document date will be the same date.\n    If the transaction date in the SAF file has a prior period date, then the entries will be posted using the current period system date and the document date field will hold the original date of the transaction.\n  \n  Viewing Journal Types in Integra\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to view the different journal types in Integra.\n  Prerequisites\n  The user must understand the usage of the different types of journals in Integra in order to post the transaction choosing the appropriate journal options and populating all required journal fields in Integra.\n  Steps\n  \n    Navigate modules to General ledger > Journal setup > Journal names.\n  \n  \n  \n    Review the list of journal names in the tab on the left.\n  \n  Result\n  You have viewed a comprehensive list of all journal names in Integra.\n  Use the Data Connector in Excel to Edit/Upload Journal Lines\n  The data connector tool provides an alternative method for journal entry only when there are no project transactions. Use the most recent version of the DynAd Journal Template (download the most recent version from IRC Master folder in Box).\n  Note: This is only used to upload journals that DO NOT have project transactions. This process mainly refers to balance sheet accounts or expense/revenue accounts that do not touch the Projects module.\n  Steps\n  \n    Ensure the data is ready in Excel before proceeding.\n    Navigate modules to General ledger > Journal entries > General journals.\n    Click New after selecting the appropriate journal Name ‘JE’ for example.\n    Click on the Microsoft icon (top right corner) and select General journal line entry.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the window that opens, click Download.\n    Open the downloaded file in Excel.\n    Wait for it to run until a pop-up message appears.\n  \n  \n  \n    Click Yes when prompted to confirm refresh.\n      Additional processing will occur, and your journal will be ready to be populated.\n    In column AG, hover on the blue line, drag it down to the expected number of lines in the journal. The two snapshots will show how column AG has changed.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Complete the Financial Dimensions based on the IRC Account structure.\n    After populating the file, click Publish.\n  \n  \n  The file will run and will show refreshed data at the bottom of the screen.\n  \n    Go back to Integra, under General Ledger > Journal Entries > General Journals and click Show user-created only to locate the journal.\n    Follow the same steps for attaching documents and submitting to workflow as explained for DynAd journal and Direct journal entries in Integra.\n  \n  Result\n  The file should be successfully imported, and the journal can be reviewed, validated, and posted.\n\n","Path::contents/Journal_Entries_DynAD_Template_Upload.htm::size":82448,"Path::contents/Cash_and_Bank_Management.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/integra-help.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Cash_and_Bank_Management.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/integra-help.css"},{"origLink":"assets/images/Cash

approximately 200 bank accounts across the globe. Each bank account is mapped to one main account to simplify bank reconciliation. Bank groups can be set up to monitor bank activity based on the group.\n  The Cash Overview Workspace provides an overview of cash in the various bank accounts. It also has a cash forecast flows forecasts where each legal entity can see the General ledger, Accounts payable, Accounts Receivable, Budgeting, and Inventory balances. This helps provide enhanced and accurate information to start the monthly cash planning/projections for the month or months ahead.\n  IRC is using a product called Treasury Automation Suite (TAS) that facilitates the ability to automate IRC’s bank reconciliation process. This software suite is a seamless integration to the Integra system.\n  Once a bank record has been created in the Cash and Bank Management module of Integra, the bank account is available to be moved into the TAS. \n  All bank accounts are reconciled on a monthly basis using the TAS. The e-reconciliation process within Integra imports bank statements and reconciles them to transactions posted in Integra. Integra maps transaction types and their associated GL accounts to bank account transaction codes in order to identify each type of bank transaction.\n  If a bank is not able to send their statement as a file, Integra allows for the reconciliation of the bank account by manually clearing the transactions in Integra. This is completed by reviewing and marking valid auto-matches and processing open matches using the Click-and-match workbench.\n  Bank Transaction Types\n  Bank transaction types have been created in Integra to capture the different transaction types that come from a bank. Journal types have also been mapped to bank transactions and a rule has been created to not allow any posting to a bank account without a bank transaction type. Below is the list of the bank transaction types in Integra:\n  \n  Cash Management and Transfers\n  Cash in Office Process\n  Some offices operate with cash in a safe for to accommodate the following situations:\n  \n    Payment to vendors who only accept cash payments\n    Payment of salary advances to expatriate staff\n    Disbursements in areas where no banks exist\n    Emergency cash for security purposes\n    Petty cash for the payment of routine and smaller expenses\n  \n  Cash and Bank Management Inquiries\n  Display Bank Account Balances via the Bank Management Workspace\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to display an overview of the balances in the various bank accounts.

The File tran type is the code that comes from the bank that, by default, maps to a Matching group (see table below). The default matching group is what IRC uses to match transactions against the bank statement with the required rules. Once established, all transactions will have an associated bank transaction type, which will match the file trans type of the bank to reconcile the transactions automatically.\n  \n  eBank Rec-Matching Group \n  The IRC enabled the DEFAULT setting to create rules for matching. All eBank reconciliations are setup under the default group. Without this group, there will be no rules and the bank transaction types will not connect to the e-statement. Below is where it sits in Integra:\n  \n  Matching Rules\n  The IRC designed the transactions to match against three default rules (and some extensions).\n  DEFAULT 1 - Reference Number and Amount: This rule looks at the payment reference against the customer reference number from the e-statement, ties it to the amount and matches with zero tolerance on date and 100% confidence.\n  \n  DEFAULT 2 - Reference Number and Amount: Like rule number 1, this matches the Deposited check number from Integra and matches it to the same reference in the e-statement if the reference and amount are the same. Date tolerance set to zero day and confidence level 100%.\n  \n  DEFAULT 3 - Date and Amount: Like other rules, this matches the check number from Integra and matches it to the same reference in the e-statement if it is the same date and amount. Date tolerance set to zero day and confidence level 100%.\n  \n  DEFAULT 4 - Date and Amount: This rule is an extension of rule 3 with a 1-day tolerance on the date of the check.\n  \n  DEFAULT 5 - Date and Amount: This is another extension of rule 3 with a 5-day check tolerance. For this rule it is recommended that the user looks up the matched transaction against this rule and verify if the match is accurate.\n  \n  Additional Rules: For the bank reconciliation to be more accurate, the Finance Officer must run the bank reconciliation daily and identify common transaction trends that can be matched if a new rule or step is created.\n  This will lead to an additional layer to help match those identical transactions. The Finance staff must also establish the balances each and every day to help accounts receivable capture receipts that have not been journalized.\n  It is recommended that there is consistent communication between the Finance officer and Accounts Receivable to journalize the receipts before month-end.\n\n","Path::contents/Cash_and_Bank_Management.htm::size":73946,"Path::contents/Beneficiary_(BENE)_Vendor_Creation_(RAI).htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/integra-help.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Beneficiary_(BENE)_Vendor_Creation_(RAI).htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/integra-help.css"},{"origLink":"assets/images/Beneficiary

(\"BENE vendor\"). \n  Vendor Record Creation\n  In Integra, the details of all persons and organizations with whom the IRC deals are stored in the global address book.\n  \n    The BENE vendors group relates to any person who is targeted for assistance, who directly benefits from, or comes in contact with, an IRC-implemented or financially supported IRC program.\n  \n  Most clients are automatically created in Integra through the ETO interface; however, non-ETO clients who do not need heightened confidentiality (i.e., their name being saved in Integra is acceptable) can be manually entered and approved by the local requestor. Examples of a requestor include but are not limited to the following roles:\n  \n    Caseworker\n    Casework Supervisor\n    Resettlement Manager\n    Anti-Trafficking Manager\n    Finance Manager\n  \n  Clients pulled in from ETO come over with active status, however, clients created directly in Integra must be submitted to workflow approval or the status will be on hold. \n  \n    Note: When submitting the client to workflow approval, the system auto-approves the record.)\n  \n  If the office has a program(s) where clients require heightened confidentiality, the generic client vendor record should be used. \n  Create Beneficiary Vendor (BENE vendor)\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to create a beneficiary vendor in Integra with standard confidentiality needs.\n  \n    BENE = Beneficiary (Client)\n    Requestor (Caseworker, Casework Supervisor, Resettlement Manager, Anti-Trafficking Manager)\n  \n  Prerequisites\n  \n    The vendor does not already exist in Integra\n    The client is a non-ETO client\n    It is confirmed that the client does not require heightened confidentiality\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    Navigate to Common > Common > Global address book.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the menu at the top of page, click New.\n  \n  \n  \n    Under the General tab, complete the following fields:\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Field\n          \n          \n            Description and/or Action Required\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Party ID\n          \n          \n            This value is automatically assigned.

Receivable","Path::contents/Accounts_Receivable.htm::InnerText":"\n  Business Process Overview\n  Accounts Receivable (AR) processing includes the following tasks:\n  \n    Adhoc receipt of daily checks, stocks or wires as donations from individuals (one-time gift)\n    Receipts of pledges (one-time gifts over a period of time)\n    Receipt of grants (grants seen on a daily basis from a country office)\n  \n  All donor receipts and intercompany transfers must be entered in Integra. Once payment is entered in Integra, it is automatically posted to the general ledger.\n  A donor may pledge a commitment to multi-year payments.\n  Rather than recording donor payments separately, a payment decrease can be applied to an account balance. Settlement within AR can occur between different transaction types that affect the customer balance, such as invoices and payments. Integra provides standard AR reporting functionality, such as customer aging and balance details. Accounts Receivable is also responsible to monitor and “draw down”.\n  Accounts Receivable Checklist\n  Daily Processing\n  \n    Salesforce journal uploads (including intercompany)\n    Cash receipts (in USD and foreign currencies)\n  \n  Month-End Processing\n  \n    Stock journals\n    Merchant fee bookings\n    IOM entries (International Organization for Migration)\n    Cash concentration entries\n    Bank fees and interest income\n    Administrative fees\n    AR reports\n  \n  Business Process Flow\n  \n  The Accounts Receivable Module in Integra\n  The following information can be accessed via the Accounts receivable module:\n  \n    For customer information, navigate to Customers.\n    To enter or view invoices, navigate to Invoices.\n    To enter or view payment information, navigate to Payments.\n    For detailed customer history, navigate to Inquiries and reports.\n  \n  \n  Process Payment from a Donor\n  Use this procedure to process a donor payment where the donor is already set up as a customer in Integra.

Settlement within Accounts Receivable can occur between all transaction types that affect the customer balance, such as invoices and payments.\n  When Accounts Receivable records a customer payment, they mark the appropriate invoices for settlement, based on the information that is included with the donor's payment. The Settle transactions page is used to mark transactions for settlement. This page can be opened from any unposted invoice or payment. When the transaction is posted, the settlement is also posted.\n  As transactions are settled, the outstanding balance of each transaction increases or decreases as appropriate. In a typical scenario, where an invoice and payment are settled, the status and balance of each transaction is updated according to the following rules:\n  \n    If the payment amount is more than the invoice amount, the invoice balance is reduced to 0.00, and the invoice is closed. The payment remains open, and the balance is the amount by which the payment exceeds the invoice amount.\n    If the payment amount is less than the invoice amount, the payment balance is reduced to 0.00, and the payment is closed. The invoice remains open, and the balance is the amount by which the payment underpaid the invoice.\n    If the payment amount equals the invoice amount, both the payment and the invoice are closed, and the balance of both is 0.00.\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    Navigate modules to Accounts receivable > Payments > Customer payment journal.\n  \n  \n  \n    Click New.\n  \n  \n   A new journal line is added at the top of the table grid.\n  \n    In the Name field, enter or select CR.\n    In the Description field, enter a meaningful description for the journal. \n    On the menu at the top of page, click Lines.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the Account field, click the drop-down arrow to perform a search for the customer name.\n    In the Description field, enter a meaningful description for the line.\n    Click Save on the menu at the top of page. \n  \n  \n  Note: A warning message displays indicating that a bank transaction type is mandatory.

A credit note or accounts payable journal entry may also be entered in Integra.\n  If the customer has multiple projects and therefore multiple D1 codes, these D1 codes will have different associated balances with each D1 code. For this reason, the procedure outlined below must not be used for customers with multiple D1 codes. The reimburse function is only available for a customer with one project.\n  For customers with more than one project and multiple D1 codes, reimbursement is made using the GL function. Refer to the procedure Reimburse a Customer/Donor using the General Ledger.\n  Steps\n  \n    Navigate modules to Accounts receivable > Customers > All customers.\n  \n  \n  A list of customers is displayed on the All customers screen.\n  \n    Select the customer account for the reversal.\n    Click Collect > Customers balances > Reimburse customer.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the Reimbursement form, click OK.\n  \n  \n  Result\n  The donor is fully reimbursed.

This procedure is executed by the Finance Manager, DDF, or another similar role.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    All month-end journal processing is complete\n    Revenue recognition is complete\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    Navigate modules to Accounts receivable > Periodic tasks > Foreign currency revaluation.\n  \n  \n  \n    Select the line item for which to process the currency revaluation.\n    Click Foreign currency revaluation on the toolbar at the top.\n  \n  The Foreign currency revaluation form opens.\n  \n  \n    Complete the following fields in the Parameters section:\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Field\n          \n          \n            Entry Required\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Method\n          \n          \n            Use Standard to post the foreign currency job no matter if there is a profit or a loss.\n            Use Minimum to post the revaluation only if it shows a loss.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Considered date\n          \n          \n            Uses the date the transactions are found. The exchange rate is for this date.\n            If a revaluation is run for an earlier date, the system will not go back to that date but will go to a more recent revaluation date.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Date of rate\n          \n          \n            This date determines the exchange rate that is used in the foreign currency revaluation. \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Use posting profile from\n          \n          \n            Use Posting for the posting profile for the customer transactions.\n            Use Select to enter the posting profile in the Posting Profile field. If you choose Select the profile decides how the revaluation is carried out.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Posting profile\n          \n          \n            Select the posting profile GENAR or CR.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Dimension\n          \n          \n            Posting – Financial dimensions will be posted on the transactions. The process defaults to the financial dimensions from your original transaction's AR ledger account for the AR main account while it defaults to the original transaction's expense/asset/revenue ledger account for the unrealized gain/loss main account for revaluation transactions.\n            Select Posting from the drop-down.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n   \n  \n    Click OK.\n  \n  \n  \n    Click Yes to the pop-up message to proceed.\n    Click X to close the Foreign currency revaluation grid.\n  \n  Result\n  You have processed a foreign currency revaluation.\n  Display Customer Aging Report\n  Purpose\n  The customer aging report contains the calculated aged balances for a customer for a period.

journal entries to Integra.\n      \n        Examples of mass upload journals include payroll allocation, subaward/expenses, re-classification of entries, and shared program cost allocation entries.\n        Selecting the correct journal name in the Dynad Journal is vital to ensure data is processed correctly in Integra.\n          \n            Behind each journal name there is systematic coding, i.e., posting profiles, that updates the Integra system in the correct way.\n            Refer to the appendix at the end of this guide for a comprehensive list of journal names and usage.\n          \n        \n        The recommendation is that if you have less than ten (10) lines, it may be easier to create the journal entries directly in Integra.\n      \n    \n    For most business tasks, transactions are posted to sub-ledgers (vs. the General Ledger).\n      \n        However, there are select transactions that get posted directly to the General Ledger.\n      \n    \n    Period statuses are used to control access for postings to ledger and sub-ledgers.\n      \n        For example, vendor (AP) and customer (AR) sub-ledgers should have all invoice/payment journals posted by the sixth working day of month-end closing. To prevent users from posting to AR/AP sub-ledgers after the sixth working day, the sub-ledgers can be “closed” for posting by changing the module status to On hold.\n      \n    \n  \n  Month-end Close Tasks (High level)\n  \n    Close/open fiscal posting periods\n      \n        This process is done at specified times itracen the month by designated Finance individuals.\n      \n    \n    Ensure all ‘daily’ transactions have been posted in correct fiscal period.\n    Post intercompany transactions.\n    Post month-end journals.\n      \n        This process refers to journal entries that are processed at month-end only\n      \n    \n    Calculate ICR and Prepare Fee Journal\n    Perform Reconciliation and Analysis\n      \n        This process includes the use of the following standard delivered Integra transactions/functionality to identify and remedy discrepancies\n          \n            Trial Balance\n            Voucher Transactions\n            Accounting Source Explorer\n            Tracing Original Entries\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    Generate Reports\n      \n        Numerous reports are available for analysis in Integra and Power BI.\n      \n    \n  \n  Month-end Close Checklist\n  Refer to the checklist in the appendix of this document. This checklist can also be found on RescueNet.\n  Important Note About This Guide:\n  For many month-end business tasks, the step-by-step procedures are documented in other sections as they are standard transactions used for day-to-day business tasks. In these instances, a reference to the applicable section/procedure is included in this document.\n  This section includes detailed procedures for tasks that are not contained within another user guide.\n  Open or Close a Fiscal Year Period\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to open or close a fiscal calendar period.\n  Once you close the current period, the new period should immediately be opened to ensure users can transact from the first day of the next period.\n  A custom “Period close” security group (PrdCls) has been defined to allow designated Finance users the ability to process periodic transactions after the period has been closed to the general user population.\n  The following period “statuses” are used to open and close fiscal calendar periods.\n  \n    Open: Open to all eligible users for transaction posting. \n    On hold: Transactions cannot be posted in the period. However, select users in Finance can post transactions for month-end reconciliation purposes.\n    Permanently closed: This status is currently not being used; once you permanently close a period, it can never be reopened again.\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra dashboard, go to General ledger > Calendars > Ledger calendars.  \n    In the left-hand panel of screen, click on the period to change.\n    Under the Legal entity column, select the legal entity to update. \n  \n  Note: After selecting the legal entity, access levels to specific modules can be defined.\n  \n    In the top left of page, click Edit.\n    Select Update Period status. \n    Click Edit at the top right-hand side to allow you to change the period status. \n    In the Period status field drop down, select On hold/Open for the period that is being closed or opened.   \n    Under the Ledger column, select PrdCls.\n  \n  \n    The Ledger column refers to the General Ledger\n    PrdCls is a custom security group created for specific Finance individuals so they can post transaction after the Period status has been updated to On hold.\n  \n  \n    If opening or closing a sub-ledger, click Update module access.\n  \n  \n    For module access update, go to the module that you want to update. \n    Select from the drop down, whether you want to restrict a module or user group. If you select “None”, it means that no posting can happen to that sub ledger.  Also, if you select any access level, it overrides the period status.  \n    All necessary adjusting entries and re-classifications will be done at this point. \n  \n  ‎ \n   \n  \n    Click Save. \n  \n  Result\n  You have opened or closed a fiscal posting period.\n   \n  Intercompany Transactions\n  Refer to the Intercompany Accounting section for specific step-by-step procedures on how to post intercompany journals.\n  The appendix of this section includes specific accounting entry requirements required based on the type of intercompany transaction being processed.\n  Month-end General Journals\n  Posting Periodic Journals\n  Periodic journals are used to post monthly charges, such as prepaid rent, prepaid insurance, etc.\n  Refer to the section, Journal Entry and Upload for specific step-by-step procedures on how to post journals.\n  There are different journal names for the various periodic charges. Refer to the Journal Name table in the Dynad Journal template for the correct selection.\n  Note: You don’t need to wait until month end to enter/post periodic charges, i.e., if you know the monthly allocation, you can enter it prior to month end.\n   \n  Post Depreciation Allocation Entries\n  Refer to the following section for step-by-step procedures on how to post journals.\n  Journal Entry and Upload\n  \n    Procedure: Using the Dynad Journal Template to Upload Journal Entrie\n    Procedure: Posting Periodic Journals\n  \n  Post Payroll Allocation Entries\n  Refer to the following section for step-by-step procedures on how to post journals.\n  Journal Entry and Upload\n  \n    Procedure: Using the Dynad Journal Template to Upload Journal Entrie\n  \n  Post Shared Program Cost Allocation Entries\n  Refer to the following section for step-by-step procedures on how to post journals.\n  Journal Entry and Upload\n  \n    Procedure: Using the Dynad Journal Template to Upload Journal Entrie\n  \n  Month-end Adjustments\n  Reverse GL Entry\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to reverse wrong entries in the GL and later record them to the correct entries. \n  Note: Only transactions originating in the GL can be reversed in the GL; any transactions posted to a sub-ledger must be reversed in that sub-ledger.\n  Steps\n  \n    After running the trial balance, double-click the transaction in the Closing balance column that needs to be reversed. \n    Click Reverse transaction.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the Transaction reversal screen, enter the Reversal posting date. \n    Click OK. \n  \n   \n  \n     Click Reversed tracing. The original and reversed transactions are displayed.  \n    Close the transaction by selecting X at the top right of the screen when the review is completed. \n  \n  Result \n  The transaction is reversed and reviewed. \n  \n  Post Project Adjustment Entries\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to recode a transaction from one project to another.\n  Adjusting project transactions in the project sub ledger automatically adjusts the corresponding general ledger posting.\n  There are two methods to adjust project transactions in Integra.\n  \n    Adjust transactions per project.\n    Adjust transactions by batch.\n  \n  Note: Only users with the correct security access can use the project adjustment form in Integra. This is because project adjustment does not have any workflow.\n  Refer to the following section for step-by-step procedures on how to post journals.\n  \n    Journal Entry and Upload\n      \n        Procedure: Using the Dynad Template to Upload Journal Entries\n        Procedure: Recoding Journal Entries\n      \n    \n  \n  Post Inventory Adjustments\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to allocate inventory adjustment values to update the relevant general ledger accounts.\n  For example, an inventory adjustment that Supply Chain previously made for damaged inventory now needs to be allocated to an insurance GL account.\n  Refer to the following user guide for step-by-step procedures on how to post journals.\n  \n    Journal Entry and Upload\n      \n        Procedure: Using the Dynad Template to Upload Journal Entries\n      \n    \n  \n  Check for Unposted Journals for Current Ledger Period\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to display unposted journals to review and action as required. E.g., post applicable journals.\n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra dashboard, go to General ledger > Journal entries > General journals.\n  \n  \n  \n    Under the Show heading, the default entry is Not posted. These are the entries to look at to determine what should have been posted in the month being closed.\n  \n  \n    This entry can be changed to Posted or All by clicking the drop-down arrow.\n  \n  \n    To determine the date a journal was entered, customize the table grid by adding the column Created date and time.\n  \n  \n    Right click on any column header and select Add columns.\n    In the filter box, enter text Created.\n    Select Created date and time from the selection list and Insert it into the table. The column will be added at the end of the current columns.\n  \n  \n    Review the list of unposted journals in the current period and action as required, e.g., post applicable journals.\n  \n  Result\n  You have identified unposted journals for the month-end close period.\n  Revenue Recognition (HQ Finance Only)\n  Revenue Recognition is run by HQ. RAI offices are responsible for calculating ICR (Indirect Cost Recovery), preparing the fee journal and submitting the journal to HQ for uploading and posting.\n  ICR is calculated and prepared in a Fee Template outside of Integra. This template can be downloaded from the following location.\n  There are two methods available for uploading ICR entries:\n  \n    Performing a mass upload of entries using the Data Connector Tool (recommended to use when there are more than 10 entries.\n    Typing ICR entries directly into Integra (option to use when there are less than 10 entries)\n  \n  Perform Mass Upload of ICR Journal Template via Data Connector Tool (HQ Finance Only)\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to use the Data Connector tool to upload mass ICR entries to Integra.\n  This is only performed by HQ Finance.\n  Prerequisites\n  The ICR Fee Template has been completed.\n  Steps\n  \n    Navigate modules to Project management and accounting > Journals > Fee. \n  \n  \n  \n    On the menu at the top, click Open in Excel and click OK.\n    Click on the Excel file to open it.  \n  \n  Note: If it is your first time using the Data Connector, you will need to install the application in your browser. Also, you will need to login using your IRC login credentials.\n  \n  \n    Activate the number of rows required to copy the data from the ICR Fee Template.  \n  \n  \n  \n    Go to the right-hand side at the edge, hold and pull down using your mouse left click. Release your mouse left click. You should see all rows activated. This means that you can access some of the data directly from Integra by clicking in an activated cell. \n    In the active cells, use copy and paste ‘special value’ in each corresponding column. \n    Click Publish.  \n  \n  ‎\n  \n    Navigate modules to Project management and accounting >Journals > Fee. \n  \n  \n    ‎\n  \n    Select your journal and click Lines at the top to display lines details. \n    On the menu at the top, click Validate to check for errors. \n    On the Check journal pop-up window, click OK to proceed. \n  \n  \n  \n    If there are no errors, a message in a blue ribbon appears near the top of the page. \n    On the menu at the top of the page, click Post.  \n  \n  Notes:\n      When you post a fee journal, it does not post to the general ledger; it is a subledger posting. The fee journal will be posted to the General Ledger at the time of revenue recognition.\n      \n      The fee journal does not use workflow; it is based on the security access given to an individual in the system. \n   \n  Enter ICR Fee Journal Directly in Integra (HQ Finance Only)\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to enter individual fee journals into Integra.\n  This is only performed by HQ Finance.\n  Prerequisites\n  The ICR Fee Template has been completed.\n  Steps\n  \n    Navigate modules to Project management and accounting > Journals > Fee. \n  \n  \n  \n    On the menu at the top of page, click New.\n  \n  ‎\n    ‎\n  \n    Select the newly added line and click Lines on the menu at the top of the page.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the menu at the top of page, click New to add journal lines.\n  \n  \n  \n    Complete the following fields for the vendor invoice line:\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Field\n          \n          \n            Entry Required\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Project date\n          \n          \n            Select the posting date.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Project ID\n          \n          \n            Enter the project D1 code.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Category\n          \n          \n            Enter the D2 (project category) that correspond to the D1 code.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Resource\n          \n          \n            Leave this field blank.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Description\n          \n          \n            Enter a description.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Sales currency\n          \n          \n            Do not change this field.\n            This value automatically defaults to the project contract currency when you select your project ID.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Sales price\n          \n          \n            Enter the fee amount.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Line property\n          \n          \n            This value defaults to Billable.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Purpose\n          \n          \n            Leave this field blank.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n   \n  \n  \n    On the menu at the top of page, click Financial dimensions. \n  \n  \n  \n    Complete the required financial dimensions and click OK.\n  \n  Note: Some financial dimensions may default based on setting applied in the project form.\n  \n  \n    On the menu at the top, click Validate to check for errors. \n  \n  \n  \n    On the Check journal pop-up window, click OK to proceed. \n  \n  \n  Note: If there are no errors, a message in a blue ribbon appears near the top of the page. \n  \n    On the menu at the top of the page, click Post.  \n  \n  Note: When you post a fee journal, it does not post to the general ledger; it is a subledger posting. It will be posted to the General Ledger at the time of revenue recognition. The fee journal does not use workflow; it is based on security access given to an individual in the system. \n   \n  Reconciliation Reports\n  Reconciliation is composed of three key steps.\n  \n    Running the reconciliation reports to identify discrepancies.\n    Using Integra’s analysis tools to find out the cause of the discrepancy.\n    Process journal entries to fix discrepancies.\n  \n  This topic identifies the reconciliation reports available in Integra, PowerBI or Excel.\n  Reconciliation Reports Reference Table\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to run the various reconciliation reports to identify discrepancies.\n  A common reason differences occur is because a transaction was posted to the General Ledger instead of the sub-ledger. Complete the To-From date fields and make sure you select the accounting currency in the Currency field. Run the report and look at the difference column. It should always be zero. If it is not zero, investigate and post the necessary adjustment entries. \n  Outlined below is a list of the reconciliation reports available in Integra, PowerBI, or Excel and their corresponding module navigation paths.\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Reconciliation Report\n          \n          \n            Menu Path\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Customer to Ledger\n          \n          \n            Accounts receivable > Inquiries and reports > Customers > Customer to ledger reconciliation report\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Vendor to Ledger\n          \n          \n            Accounts payable > Inquiries and reports > Vendor reports > Vendor to ledger reconciliation\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Project to Ledger\n          \n          \n            General ledger > Inquiries and reports > Consolidation reports > GL-to-Project Reconciliation\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Bank to Ledger\n          \n          \n            Treasury Automation Suite > Inquiries > Bank > Bank/GL statement reconciliation\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Automated/Manual Bank\n          \n          \n            Accounts receivable > Inquiries and reports > Customers > Customer to ledger reconciliation report\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Balance Sheet Reconciliation (for balance sheet accounts that don’t belong to a sub-ledger)\n          \n          \n             \n            Refer to list of main accounts in Month-end Close Checklist\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Benefit % Allocations for Personnel – Salary Expenses\n          \n          \n            This report is available in PowerBI.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n   \n  Inquiries and Reports for Discrepancy Analysis\n  The following key inquiries are used repeatedly and iteratively in Integra for analyzing data and resolving discrepancies for month-end close purposes. Data can be exported from these inquiries to Excel for easier investigation.\n  \n    Trial Balance\n    Voucher Transactions\n    Accounting Source Explorer (ASE)\n    Audit Trail\n    Trace Original Entries\n  \n  Run Trial Balance Report\n  Purpose\n  The Trial Balance is a list page that shows all the balances of an account and/or financial dimensions for a given period. When the trial balance is first opened it refreshes with the balances for the dates and properties that are set in the parameters. Properties that can be changed in the parameters include dates, posting layer, how opening balances appear, and what closing transaction types to show. \n  When you change the parameters, the balances are refreshed. You can also pick what dimension set you want to view balances for and whether each of the dimensions show in separate columns. You can also drill down on the balances to view the transactions that make up the balance. \n  Steps \n  \n    Go to General ledger > Inquiries and reports > Trial balance. \n  \n    \n  \n    In the From date field, enter the beginning date for the monthly balance. \n    In the To date field, enter the ending date for the monthly balance a date. \n    Click Calculate balances. \n  \n   \n  \n    Once the trial balance is completed, you can double-click on the balances to view the transactions that make up the balance. \n    Close the transaction by selecting the X at the top right of the screen when the review is completed. \n  \n   \n   \n  Result\n  The Trial Balance has been generated. \n  Export the trial balance to Microsoft Excel \n  \n    On the Trial Balance screen, click the Microsoft button and select EXPORT TO EXCEL > Trial Balance. \n  \n    \n  \n    Click Open to open the Excel file on your computer or click Save to save it on your computer. \n  \n   \n  The Trial Balance can be analysed in Excel. It lists the name of each nominal ledger account and the value of that nominal ledger balance, with either a debit balance or a credit balance, as well as a closing balance:  \n   \n  Display Voucher Transactions\n  Purpose\n  To get details of transactions posted in the system, we use voucher transactions in General ledger. This pulls out all the transactions and one can limit it by date, journal, voucher number and main account. Voucher transactions can be pulled out irrespective of the date range.  \n  Steps \n  \n    Navigate modules to General ledger > Inquiries and reports > voucher transactions. \n  \n   \n  \n    Leave everything blank if you want to pull out all the transactions. Otherwise complete a specific detail in the criteria column that you know about the transaction to download. \n  \n   \n  \n    Review results.\n  \n  \n  Run Accounting Source Explorer\n  Purpose\n  Another method used to get transaction details form the system is using the accounting source explorer. Like the trial balance, this brings out transactions but only limited to a calendar year.   \n  Steps \n  \n    Navigate modules to General ledger > Inquiries and reports > Accounting source explorer. \n    On the Update menu, select the date range. \n    Click Update. \n  \n   \n  The transactions are automatically displayed based on the default setting in the Financial dimensions field.  \n  \n    Click the Financial Dimensions field to select any relevant dimension combination.\n  \n   \n  You can export to excel as previously discussed in the trial balance example. \n  View Audit Trail Report in General Ledger\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to view the view the person that posted a specific transaction.\n  Integra has the ability at every given time to know you posted the transaction in the system. There two methods to determine who posted the transaction:  \n  \n    The Audit trail report in the General Ledger module\n    The transaction method \n  \n  Note: You can also view the audit trial from within the Trial Balance transaction by clicking the Audit train menu at the top of the page.\n  Steps \n  \n    Go to General ledger > Inquiries and reports > Audit trail \n    A list of records will open. The column Created by shows who posted the transaction. \n  \n  ‎\n   \n  \n    If you want to see the details of the transactions, select only one transaction. \n    Click on Voucher transactions. \n  \n   \n  \n    Review results.\n  \n   \n  Trace Original Entries Original Documents and Related Vouchers\n  Purpose\n  In Integra, you can trace the origin of a transaction back to the original documentation and related vouchers.\n  Original journal entries can be viewed via the following transactions:\n  \n    Voucher transactions \n    Accounting Source Explorer\n    Trial Balance\n  \n  \n    ‎The related vouchers feature is used to trace intercompany transactions. This enables you to see which legal entity an entry originated from.\n  Steps \n  \n    Log into Integra and navigate to Voucher transactions in General Ledger module. \n    In the screen that opens, select the transaction for which you want to trace its origin. \n    Look at the tool bar to locate the tracing features. \n  \n   \n  \n    Click on original document in the features shown above.  \n    In the window that opens, click on View details.  \n  \n   \n  \n    In the window that opens, you will see a one-line journal voucher. Click Voucher to see the full entry journal entry \n  \n   \n  \n    View the original entry. \n  \n   \n  \n    To know if the transaction came from another legal entity, the Related vouchers feature must be active.  After selecting a transaction, look at the tool bar to see if the Related vouchers feature is active. If so, click it and a table will open. \n  \n    \n  \n    In the table that opens, you will see all the legal entities listed. If you wish to see the journal voucher, click on Voucher. \n  \n    \n  Month-end Close Reports Reference Table\n  The following reports should be run after month-end close is complete.\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Report\n          \n          \n            Location\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Final Trial Balance\n          \n          \n            In Integra, navigate to General ledger > Inquiries and reports > Trial balance.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Revenue and Expense Report\n          \n          \n            This report exists in PowerBI.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Project BvA\n          \n          \n            These reports exist in PowerBI.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            FM01 Equivalent Report\n          \n          \n            This report exists in PowerBI.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Integra Journal Names and Usage\n  Additional notes have been added to certain journal names for clarification.\n  Insert table once finalized.\n  \n  Month-end Close Checklist (RAI US Offices)\n  This checklist outlines key tasks and dates required to complete financial month-end close.

Table Grid Layouts","Path::contents/Personalization_Overview.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Personalizing Table Grids in Integra\n    The Integra system has many tabular grid screens for viewing and entering information. Some examples are, All purchase orders grid, Vouchers grid, All projects grid. There are default grid layouts automatically applied by the Integra system but often these default layouts contain columns that are not applicable to a user or they may be missing columns that would be valuable for a user. As such, the system allows a user to customize the grid layout to suit their personal needs. This document contains the following step-by-step procedures for customizing a grid layout.\n    \n      Adding and hiding columns\n      Moving column positions within the table grid\n      Activating the footer on a table grid to display additional information such as grand totals for numeric fields\n      Saving and naming a layout for a unique purpose\n      Setting a layout as the default display each time the screen is accessed.\n    \n    Using the All projects grid as a sample, the screenshot below identifies access points to the personalization features.\n    \n    Additional Notes\n    A personalized layout can be saved with any name. It defaults to “My view” but this text can be overwritten with any text. An asterisk next to the view name indicates a change has been made to the layout currently displayed. The change must be saved in order to have the changes available for future use. Columns widths can be changed by dragging the double-sided arrow that appears when you hover the mouse on the border between two column headers . This is useful to see full descriptions when the default width is too small.\n    Note: The screenshots depicted in the following procedures use select table grids as examples but the steps are valid for most table grids in Integra. You must save any changes to a grid layout before exiting the page if you want them to remain active each time you access the table grid. This is done by selecting the drop-down arrow next to the view name, e.g., “Standard view” or “My view”.\n    Select a Default View\n    Steps\n    \n      Display the current default view.\n      Click the drop-down arrow next to the current view (e.g., Standard view).\n    \n    \n    \n      Select the new view to display from the list (e.g., Purchase Order List Page).\n    \n    \n    The page refreshes to display the selected view.\n    \n      Click the drop-down arrow next to the current view (e.g., Purchase Order List Page).\n    \n    \n    \n      Click the ellipsis icon (....) in the bottom right corner.\n      Click Pin as default.\n    \n    \n    Note: The pin icon now indicates that the selected view is the default.\n    \n    Result\n    You have selected a default view to display each time you return to this form.\n    Add a Column in a Table Grid Layout\n    Steps\n    \n      Display the table grid screen.\n    \n    \n    \n      Right-click on any column heading and select Add columns from the drop-down menu.\n    \n    \n    \n      A pop-up window appears that displays all the available columns to add. Search for and select the checkbox next to the applicable column(s) to add and then click Insert.\n    \n    Note: The new columns are added to the end of the table.

(See screenshot below.) If you don’t do this, the changes made will not be saved for the next time.\n    \n    \n    Note: An asterisk displayed next to the view title is an alert that a change has been made to the grid layout in the current visit to the page and changes should be saved, if required.\n    Result\n    You have personalized a grid table layout by adding a column(s) to the table.\n    Hide a Column in a Table Grid Layout\n    Steps\n    \n      Display the table grid screen.\n    \n    \n    \n      Right click on the specific column header to be hidden and select Hide this column from the drop-down menu.\n      To save the changes so they stay active each time you access the grid, click the drop-down next to the view title, e.g., Standard view or My view, then click Save or Save as…. button.

Click the plus sign to ‘show totals’ for that column.\n    \n    \n    \n      Validate the total has displayed.\n    \n    Note: If you no longer want to see a total in a particular column, right-click on the column and select Hide total or hover on the total amount and click the X that appears.\n    \n      Save the changes.\n    \n    Result\n    You have personalized a table layout by activating the table footer to view grand totals for a column.\n     \n    Save Personalized Display for Future Use\n    Steps\n    \n      Display a table grid screen.\n    \n    \n    \n      Make changes to a table grid layout using the steps provided in previous sections, then click the drop-down arrow next to Standard view.\n    \n    \n    \n      In the pop-up window, click Save as.\n    \n    Note: If you are making changes to an existing personalized view, Click Save (not “Save as”) and it will automatically save the changes to your existing personalized view.\n     \n    \n    \n      In the Name field, enter any name for the new layout. (This field defaults to “My view” but can be overwritten with any text).\n    \n    Optional: In the Description text box, a more detailed description can be entered. If you want the new layout to be the default layout each time you access the specific table, change the indicator to Yes under Pin as default view.\n    \n      Save changes.\n    \n    Result\n    You have created and saved a personalized table grid view that can be used again or set as the default display each time the screen is accessed.\n     \n  \n\n","Path::contents/Personalization_Overview.htm::size":21736,"Path::contents/UG_PRJ_Project_Amendments_QA.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/integra-help.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/UG_PRJ_Project_Amendments_QA.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/integra-help.css"},{"origLink":"assets/images/UG_PRJ_Project Amendments_QA_files/image1.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/UG_PRJ_Project_Amendments_QA.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/UG_PRJ_Project Amendments_QA_files/image1.png"}],"Path::contents/UG_PRJ_Project_Amendments_QA.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/UG_PRJ_Project_Amendments_QA.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/UG_PRJ_Project_Amendments_QA.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/UG_PRJ_Project_Amendments_QA.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/UG_PRJ_Project_Amendments_QA.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/UG_PRJ_Project_Amendments_QA.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"Key_Messages","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"Roles_and_Responsibilities_Matrix","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"Amendments_Initiated_in_OTIS","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"Amendments_Not_Initiated_in_OTIS","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"The_Budget_Development_Template","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"Addition_of_Sub-award_Sub-project_as_Amendment","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"Populate_the_Budget_Development_Template_for_Amendment_1","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"Upload_Project_Templates_to_Integra","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"Update_Project_Information_in_Integra_(Finance_Function_Only)","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"Appendix","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"Amendment_Types_and_Process_Steps_in_Integra","tagName":"a","innerText":""}],"Path::contents/UG_PRJ_Project_Amendments_QA.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/UG_PRJ_Project_Amendments_QA.htm::Title":"","Path::contents/UG_PRJ_Project_Amendments_QA.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Business Process Information\n    Key Messages\n    \n      \n        All budget amendments, whether they require donor approval or not, and regardless of the value and complexity, are processed in Integra\n      \n      \n        Budget holders play an important role in the budget revision process\n      \n      \n        There is a standardized Budget Template used for preparing and amending Integra budget upload files\n      \n      \n        All budget revisions are submitted to workflow for approval\n      \n      \n        After workflow approval is complete, Finance posts all amended budgets to the budget register in Integra.\n      \n    \n    Roles and Responsibilities Matrix\n    \n    Amendments Initiated in OTIS\n    - The OTIS process for D1 updates is the same as before Integra\n    - Amendments typically initiated in OTIS include:\n    \n      Restricted Projects where the change requires donor approval.\n      Temporary Restricted Projects where there is a change in the receiving unit (D4 – HQ Unit/D5 – CRRD/RAI field legal entity) regardless of whether donor approval is required or not.\n      Multi-entity Projects (Restricted and Temporary restricted funding) regardless of whether donor approval is required or not, particularly when there is a change in the receiving unit (D4 – HQ Unit/D5 – CRRD/RAI field legal entity). This ensures that the updated award/obligated amounts are reflected accurately in each Integra entity.\n      Sub award sub projects where a new sub award is added to the parent project or there is an amendment to sub award budgets. This would apply to all sub award sub projects regardless of the funding source and whether donor approval is required or not.\n    \n    - For amendments processed in OTIS, the following fields on the D1 overview page transfer to Integra:\n    \n      End date\n      Total obligated amount\n      Total award amount\n      Receiving units (D4 and/or D5 financial dimension).\n        \n          The D5 receiving unit determines the Integra legal entity to which the project information from the OTIS interface is sent.\n          The D4 receiving unit determines which HQ D4, within the HQ Integra legal entity, is allocated funds for the project. It is important to note that while OTIS holds each budget allocation by D4, Integra only brings over the Total budget amount.\n        \n      \n    \n    - For sub award sub projects initiated in OTIS, the following fields from the sub award D1 extension page transfer to Integra:\n    \n      D1 Extension/Sub-Project ID\n      Legal Entity/Company\n      Project Name and Sub-award Vendor\n      Actual Start Date \n      Actual End Date \n      Total Award Amount \n      Obligated Amount \n    \n    - Change in project stage\n    \n      When the budget revision checkbox is flagged on the D1 update in OTIS, there is an automatic update to the project stage in Integra (from ‘Active’ to ‘Budget Revision’). The change in the project stage alerts Finance that a project budget revision has been processed in OTIS and is ready to be updated in Integra.\n      When Finance finalizes the posting of the revised budget register entry, adds new project categories (if applicable) and amends the funding limits (if applicable), the project stage must be changed back to ‘Active’.\n      If a project amendment does not include a change in the budget, the project stage remains ‘Active’ in Integra.\n    \n    ‎\n    Note: When a project was created in OTIS with the incorrect legal entity, and the correction is made in OTIS, the correction does not flow through to Integra. Therefore, Integra must be manually updated to remove the wrong project from Integra.\n    Amendments Not Initiated in OTIS\n    - Budget re-alignments not requiring donor approval are not typically managed in OTIS. These would include:\n    \n      Restricted Projects – those single entity projects where, if required and approved, the same process is followed in Integra as other amendment types, however, they are not typically initiated in OTIS. E.g., an office has a USAID grant and they want to move budget lines between Health and Protection or from one field site to another field site.\n      Temporary Restricted Projects – those projects in one D4 and/or D5 that have a budget change not requiring donor approval.\n      Unrestricted Projects – managed by the FP&A unit directly in Integra.\n      Multi- Entity Projects –whilst these projects are implemented in multiple legal entities, when there is a change to a single entity budget that does not require donor approval and does not change budget allocations per receiving unit i.e D5 and/or D4.\n    \n    Note: Finance still needs to approve all internal amendments to any budget and its funding limits before uploading to Integra.\n    Using the Budget Template\n    The Budget Template is a standardized template used to develop and amend project budgets.\n    The Budget Template is used for amending all project budgets - restricted, unrestricted, and temporary restricted.\n    There are two Integra budget development template folders available on Box:\n    \n      Standard Project Category Template\n      Unique Project Category Template\n    \n    Ensure you are using the correct template!\n    \n      All unrestricted projects use standard project categories\n      Temporary restricted may use either standard or unique project categories; this is a judgment call based on the specific project.\n      Restricted projects may use unique or standard project categories. Examples of when each would be used are listed below.\n        \n          US Gov – use standard project categories\n          European (ECHO funding) - use unique project categories\n        \n      \n    \n    The main types of budget revisions done in the Budget Template include the following:\n    \n      Adding or removing budget lines (project categories)\n      Re-allocating budget amounts between existing budget lines\n      Adding or removing a sub-project\n      The revised budget information provided to Finance is captured within the Input tab sheet and the Data Source sheet of the Budget Development Template.\n    \n    Addition of Subaward Sub-project as Amendment\n    When a sub award was not final when the parent project was initially set up, but details are now known, the parent project requires an amendment to include the sub-award sub-project budget at the level of detail required.\n    Once sub award budget details are known, the sub award agreement has been processed and the D1 extension code has been issued in OTIS, a sub-project is created in Integra with sub award information from OTIS. The partner name assigned to the sub award in OTIS is linked to the sub-awardee vendor name in Integra.\n    At this point, finance needs to reverse the placeholder lump sum budget line out of the parent project and add detailed budget lines to the sub project\n    \n      Main account 76000 is used for sub-awards totaling less than $25,000.00.\n      Main account 76001 is used for sub-awards totaling greater than $25,000.00\n    \n    When setting up the sub award budget as part of the sub project (D1_extension), the sub award budget in Integra should reflect the actual detailed sub award budget.\n    In most cases, the detailed sub award budget follows the IRC budget categories and these should also be used to distinguish between sub award salaries, benefits, travel, equipment, program supplies, administrative costs etc.\n    Populate the Budget Development Template for an Amendment\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to enter amendment information into the Budget Template.\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      All required amendment information is known.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Create a copy of the original completed Budget Template and save it in an “Amendments” folder on local drive or Box drive.\n      Open the copy of the Budget Template and make/save changes.\n    \n     \n    Next Steps\n    \n      Finance uploads amended budgets to Integra.\n    \n     \n    Upload Amended Project Templates to Integra \n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to upload amended Project Category, Budget Register, and Funding Limit templates to Integra.\n    Steps\n    \n      Using the standard file upload function in Box, upload the completed template to the target Box location.\n      Validate the file has disappeared from the Box folder. This indicates the upload has taken place.\n      Review the email sent that indicates if the upload was successful or not.\n      View/validate the uploaded information in Integra.\n    \n    Next Steps\n    \n      Update information in Integra, as required.\n      Submit amended budget for approval by Finance using Workflow.\n    \n    Update Project Information in Integra \n    Purpose\n    Finance uses this procedure to identify and complete any required updates directly in the Integra project form. Depending on the amendment, the following tasks may need to be done to complete the amendment.\n    \n      Submit budget to workflow for approval and repost to General Ledger.\n      Change the project stage back to “Active”\n      Remove preaward classification\n      Change the emergency classification.\n      Invalidate project categories.\n    \n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Amended templates have been uploaded to Integra.

via Workflow\n  \n  Key Messages\n  \n    The use of spending plans is highly recommended for the forecasting and monitoring of how, and when, costs are incurred on grants.\n    The allocated budget amounts must equal the total budget amount authorized to spend, i.e., Obligated budget.\n    The spending plan should follow the donor format (where applicable) and each line of the spending plan represents the project categories set up in the budget.\n    A spending plan can be created at any time after a project has been setup in Integra.\n    A spending plan can be downloaded to Excel at any time to Excel to make updates.\n  \n  Things to Consider when Allocating Amounts across Periods\n  \n    Projected expenses should be captured in the month the expense will be paid. This is important to remember because there is usually a difference in time between when:\n      \n        goods/supplies are received and vendors are paid\n        subaward expense reports are received and the subaward advance has been cleared and expenses booked in Integra\n        salaries are earned and salaries are paid\n        trips have been taken and travel advances have been cleared and expenses have been paid.\n      \n    \n    Expenses paid by HQ or another IRC office:\n      \n        Sometimes the period of time between the two events can cross over from one month to the next, one quarter to the next, or one year to the next. For DFID forecasting purposes, this distinction between the two events becomes even more important when preparing accurate cash forecasts.\n      \n    \n  \n  Questions to Answer when Creating your Spending Plan\n  \n    What are the timings of certain program activities?\n    Have you recruited all your staff?\n    Are the salaries any different than what was budgeted?\n    Which month did staff start on the project?\n    What are the procurement lead times for goods and services to be procured during the project period?\n    If program or travel advances are taken, will they be cleared in the same month or the following month\n    In which month will the activity be paid for?\n    What currency should be applied to the spending plan?\n    Is this project starting late? i.e., will spending be possible for the total budget amount in the remaining time?\n  \n  Find Budget Register Entry Number for the Project\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to determine the budget register entry number. This number is required when creating the spending plan.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    Budget register entry exists in Integra\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra home page, navigate to Budgeting > Basic budgeting > Budget account entries.\n  \n  \n  \n    Enter filter criteria, as required, e.g., Select Obligated in the Budget model field.\n    On the top menu, click Apply parameters. (This may take a few seconds)\n  \n  \n     \n  \n    Review the results list. The project ID can be seen in the financial dimension string under the Dimension values column.\n    Scroll to the right in the grid to view more information.\n    To filter results for a specific project, click the Dimension values column header to activate the filter window. In the filter field, enter the project ID enclosed between two asterisks (wild cards) and click Apply, e.g., *TF182*. (This is the same as selecting the filter option “contains”)\n    View (and make note of) the budget entry (BE) number related to the specific project.\n  \n  End of procedure\n  View Budget Cycle\n  Purpose\n  Budget cycles are set up by Finance and are a pre-requisite to performing the follow-on spending plan procedures. If there is an existing budget cycle that aligns with the spending plan being created, proceed to the next procedure in this guide, Create Budget Planning Process. If there is no suitable budget cycle, contact Finance to initiate set up of required cycle.\n  Steps\n  \n    Navigate to Budgeting > Setup > Budget planning > Budget cycles.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the left-hand pane, check to see if any of the existing Budget cycles are suitable for the required spending plan. If there is a suitable cycle, proceed to the next procedure in this guide, Create Budget Planning Process.\n  \n  End of procedure\n  Create Budget Planning Process\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to create a budget planning process. The budget planning process relates all the different elements of a budget plan together for successful spending plan creation, e.g., budget cycle, workflow assignment, and spending plan layout.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    Budget register entry number is known\n    Budget cycle exists in Integra\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    Navigate to Budget > Setup > Budget planning > Budget planning process.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the menu at the top, click New.\n      \n      Note: If there is an existing budget planning process in the left pane that aligns to the new project spending plan, use the “Copy” function by clicking Actions > Copy on the top menu and change the budget planning process name to reflect the new project ID.

When the budget plan is opened in Excel, the Remaining Budget (calculated) column automatically calculates and populates with the remaining budget values.\n  \n    In the right-hand Data Connector pane, click Publish to upload the revised amounts back to Integra.\n  \n  Troubleshooting: There is a common issue with opening Excel where the data does not come through. The troubleshooting step that resolves this issue (95% of the time) is signing out of Excel by selecting the username in the data connector section and selecting sign out. Then close the Excel document and try to download again from within integra. The user will be prompted to sign into their account in Excel.\n  End of procedure\n  Add Actuals to Spending Plan\n  \n    Navigate to Budgeting > Budget Plans. \n    Search for, and open, the relevant budget plan. \n    To add actuals to the plan, on the Budget plan lines toolbar, click Add from > General ledger.\n  \n  \n  \n    Complete the following fields.\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Section /Field\n          \n          \n            Entry Required\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Source section\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Action\n          \n          \n            Select Update the existing budget plan scenario and append new data from the drop-down selection list.\n            Note: Do not use the Replace option as previously extracted data may be lost.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Aggregate total by\n          \n          \n            Select Fiscal period from the drop-down selection list.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Fiscal year\n          \n          \n            Select the relevant fiscal year from the drop-down selection list.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            From period\n          \n          \n            Select the relevant From period from the drop-down selection list.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            To period\n          \n          \n            Select the relevant To period from the drop-down selection list.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Account type\n          \n          \n            Select Expense from the list.\n            Important: To transfer fee actuals, ‘Revenue’ will also need to be selected but due to the nature of the transactions, expense and revenue transactions must be retrieved in two separate actions.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Target section\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Historical\n          \n          \n            Select Yes from the drop-down selection list.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Budget plan scenario\n          \n          \n            Select Actuals from the drop-down selection list.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Budget class\n          \n          \n            Select Expense from the drop-down selection list.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Click Generate to retrieve the “expense actuals.\n    Repeat steps 3 through 5 to retrieve the “revenue actuals”.\n    Different Entries: In the Account type list, select Revenue and in the Budget class field, select Revenue.

 \n    Business Process Overview\n    Business Process Flow\n    Purchase Requisition to Payment  \n    \n    \n    Three-way Matching\n    The three-way match compares the pricing and quantities in the PO, the product receipt and the invoice. If the quantities and prices match, the three-way match is considered successful and the vendor can be paid. \n    \n    If there are discrepancies in the matching process, AP (Accounts Payable) must investigate and resolve the differences before payment to the vendor can be made.  \n    PO Invoice Processing\n    The use of purchase orders allow approvers, Accounts Payable, and Supply Chain, to easilyand quickly track vendor and purchase-related documentation.  \n    When a vendor invoice is received by IRC Finance, the received PO can be invoiced.   \n    \n    Non-PO Invoice Processing\n    IRC processes many invoices that do not originate with a PR/PO. These are often payments made to beneficiaries as direct assistance, smaller procurement of offices supplies or perishable goods, purchases of assets by refugees through a third party, recurring bills, sub-grants, or contracts below $2500.\n    Non-PO invoices may also be used for FCM travel, Box, phone bills, etc.\n    Procedures\n    Process a PO Invoice\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to create a vendor invoice that references a purchase order.\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Goods or services have been received\n      PO number is known\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      From the Integra home page, navigate modules to Accounts payable > Purchase orders > Purchase orders received but not invoiced.\n    \n    \n    Note: By default, all POs displayed on this page all have approval status Confirmed and purchase order status Received; partially received POs are not listed. To see partially received POs, remove the filter in the Purchase order status column.\n    \n      In the table grid list, select the PO to be invoiced.\n      Click the Invoice tab at the top of page then, under the Generate fast tab select Invoice.\n    \n    \n    \n      Expand the Vendor invoice header fast tab (if not already expanded).\n      In the Number field, enter the vendor invoice number. \n      In the Invoice description field, enter a description of the invoice. \n      Scroll down to the invoice Lines section.\n    \n    \n    \n      Verify that the PO quantity, unit of measure, unit price and line net amount match the invoice values.  \n    \n    Note: If expense is subject to VAT, populate the Item sales tax group field on the Setup tab in the Line details section of invoice. .\n    \n      Once invoice is complete, on the menu at the top of page, click Workflow and select Submit.\n    \n    \n    \n      On the Vendor invoice workflow window, enter a comment for the approver and click Submit again.\n    \n    Note: The vendor invoice journal is submitted for approval. Once approved, the status of the invoice will be listed as Approved. \n    \n      Close the page by selecting X at the top right of the form or pressing the Esc key on your keyboard. \n    \n    Note: If the journal was not approved, be sure to review the journal lines and the attached invoice document. \n    Result\n    The invoice is now submitted for approval.\n    Process a Non-PO Invoice\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to create an invoice that does not reference a PO.\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Vendor invoice has been received.\n      It has been validated that a PO does not exist for the expenditure.\n      Project ID and financial dimensions are known.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      From the Integra home page, navigate modules to Accounts payable >  Invoices >  Invoice journal.\n    \n    \n    \n      Click New on the Invoice journal form.  A blank invoice journal line will appear. \n    \n    ‎\n    \n      In the Name field, enter or select AP_INV. \n      On the menu at the top, click Lines. \n    \n    \n    \n       Enter the following fields for the Vendor invoice journal: \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Field\n            \n            \n              Entry Required\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Account type\n            \n            \n              Leave the default value of Vendor.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Account\n            \n            \n              Enter the vendor account number. \n              Tip: If vendor number is unknown, start typing the name of the vendor in this field and the system will propose entries.

When the bank rejects the payment, the bank might charge a fee for the return of funds, however, sometimes there are no fees.  Therefore, we are going to look at how to book bank return entries with and without fees when EFT is the payment method. \n    Bank Returns Without Fees\n    \n      Invoice – Received from vendor \n      Payment – Send payment to the Bank by EFT \n      Return Payment Reversal – Use the EFT “reverse posted payment”. \n      Unsettle the payment against invoice 1 and 2 and settle 2 and 3. \n      New payment journal – Resend payment to the Bank.\n      Settle 1 and 5 (This will automatically settle when you use the settlement functionality in the vendor payment journal). \n    \n    ‎\n    Bank Returns With Fees\n    Here is a quick summary of steps that need to happen in order to properly book returns in Integra when the EFT payment method is used. \n    \n      Invoice – Received from vendor \n      Payment – Send payment to the Bank by EFT  \n      Return Payment Reversal and Bank fee – Use General Journal to book the reversal.\n      Unsettle the payment against invoice 1 and 2. AND Settle 2 and 3. \n      New payment journal – Resend payment to the Bank. \n      Settle 1 and 5 (This will automatically settle when you use the settlement functionality in the vendor payment journal). \n    \n    ‎\n    Note: The only step that is different from booking returns without fee mentioned above to booking returns with bank fees is STEP 3.  For Bank Returns with Fee, we are going to use the General Journals to book the return.  This is because we need to use Project for the bank fee. Note that you cannot use the Project sub-ledger in the Vendor Payment Journal.\n    Process a Bank Return (without fee)\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to process a bank return without a fee. \n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Invoice has been received from vendor.\n      Payment has been sent to Bank via EFT.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      From the Integra home page, navigate modules to Treasury Automation Suite > Periodic > Accounts payable > Create and Send AP EFT + files. \n    \n     \n    \n      Select the EFT payment. with status Completed. that you want to reverse.\n      Click File details on the top menu.\n    \n     \n    \n      Click Reverse Posted Payment. \n      A window will pop-up, click Reverse. \n    \n     \n    \n      Validate that a reverse vendor payment journal number displays in the blue ribbon at the top of page. \n    \n     \n    \n      Go to Accounts Payable > Payments > Vendor payment journal.\n      Check Show user-created only to see the vendor payment journal number that was created when you clicked Reverse. \n    \n     \n    \n      Click on Lines at the top to view the line details. Notice that the vendor is credited, and the bank is debited. Follow the normal steps to validate, submit to workflow, and post after approval.\n      Unsettle the payment against invoice 1 and 2 and settle 2 and 3 (this is automatically done by the system).\n    \n    New Payment Journal – Resend Payment to Bank. \n    \n      Go to Accounts Payable > Payments > Vendor payment journal. \n      Click New at the top. \n      In Name field, select PAYMT. \n      Click Lines at the top. \n      In the Account field, enter the vendor account number.\n         \n      Click Settle transactions (This action automatically settles the open invoice). \n    \n    Note: For screenshots, please refer to the normal vendor payment journal procedure. \n    Result\n    A bank return (without fee) has been processed.\n    Process a Bank Return (with fee)\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to process a bank return with a fee. \n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Invoice has been received from vendor.\n      Payment has been sent to Bank via EFT.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate modules to General Ledger > Journal entries > General Journals.  \n    \n     \n    \n      Click New at the top.\n      In the Name field, select JE from the drop-down selection list. \n    \n     \n    \n      Click Lines at the top. \n       In the Account type field, select Project.\n           \n      In the Account field, enter the project ID.

In these situations, the applicable VAT rate must be applied on all affected vendor invoices entered into Integra.\n    *There may be a few projects that are granted VAT exemption, e.g., World Bank projects and USAID projects. In these instances, the VAT charge is reimbursed.\n    Alternatively, some vendors may be subject to a withholding tax. In these situations, the applicable withholding tax rate must be applied on all vendor payment journals for the vendor.\n    In some cases, a vendor may be subject to both VAT and a withholding tax so both must be applied respectively.\n    Withholding Tax Categories per Country\n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n

Trade-Cash-PFS","Path::contents/Vendor_Creation_-_Trade-Cash-PFS.htm::InnerText":"\n  Vendor Record Creation\n  In Integra, the details of all persons and organizations with whom the IRC deals are stored in the global address book.\n  \n    The Trade Vendors group is for entities (organizations or persons) from which the IRC buys products or services.\n    The Cash Vendors group handles the transfer and/or distribution of cash on behalf of the IRC in exchange for payment from the IRC.\n    The Professional Fundraising Services group works with the IRC to help develop and implement strategies and programs to solicit donor funds in exchange for payment from the IRC.\n  \n  For a vendor to be entered in Integra, an authorized Requestor must first search for the vendor in Integra to determine if it already exists. If it does not exist, the Global Supply Chain Master Data Management (MDM) team will create the Vendor.\n  The MDM team will first search the vendor in Integra and if it does not exist the team will create a new vendor and submit for review and approval. If the annual anticipated spend is greater than $2,500, or if it exceeded $2,500 during the year, the vendor is automatically placed on Hold and the Requestor must submit an ATC Check.\n  The MDM team will analyze the results of the ATC Check and determine if the vendor must remain on hold or be placed on the debar list. If the vendor passes the ATC Check, the MDM team will review the appropriate documentation and place the vendor on Active and add to the appropriate legal entity, as needed.\n  The MDM team will do the following as applicable:\n  \n    if requestor opened a ServiceNow ticket, the MDM team updates that ticket.\n    If the requestor emails to the Tradevendor creation mailbox (Tradevendor.Creation@rescue.org), the MDM team replies to that message.\n    For any other communication channel used to initiate a request, the MDM team will direct the requestor to open a ServiceNow ticket.\n  \n  Emergency Vendor Creation Requirements for RAI Offices\n  For vendors that require a payment of less than $2,500 USD be issued by the end of the same business day, a designated staff member in that RAI office will create a Trade vendor record with the basic information required for Finance to issue a check to that vendor. The vendor record is created and submitted to workflow for a different designated staff member to review and approve.\n  \n    The vendor record is routed to a reviewer in the RAI office. After review and approval, the vendor is activated.\n    Designated Finance staff in the RAI office then processes the payment for that vendor.\n    The next business day, the same staff member that created the vendor record contacts the vendor to ensure the vendor completes the vendor information form (available on RescueNet), and then provides that completed vendor information form to the MDM team.\n    The MDM team updates the vendor record information and assumes future management of that vendor record.\n  \n  The Emergency Vendor Creation process outlined above is to be used in emergency or time sensitive situations, for example:\n  \n    A new vendor record is needed to make a payment for a critical need such as rent for a beneficiary in order to prevent the beneficiary from being evicted from their place of residence.\n    A new vendor record is needed to make a payment to allow the IRC to quickly relocate a beneficiary that is suspected to be in danger related to domestic violence, human trafficking, etc.\n  \n  The above process does NOT apply to situations that do not meet the emergency criteria such as the following:\n  \n    A vendor needs to be paid quickly, but the office did not follow the standard vendor creation process.\n  \n  High Level Business Process\n  \n  Create a Vendor Record (Trade, Cash, or Professional Fundraising Service Vendors)\n  Purpose\n  To create a Trade, Cash, or Professional Fundraising Service Vendor in Integra.\n  \n    TRADE = Trade vendor\n    CASH = Cash vendor\n    PFS = Professional Fundraising Service vendor\n  \n  Trigger\n  \n    A Vendor Information Form (P42) completed by the Vendor or the IRC Requestor.\n    An Integra ticket submitted to Integra Support.\n  \n  Prerequisites\n  \n    Vendor does not already exist in Integra.\n    A completed Vendor Information Form (P42).\n  \n  Owner\n  \n    Global Supply Chain (GSC) Master Data Management (MDM) team.\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    Access the Integra Home page dashboard, click on hamburger icon at the top left corner of the dashboard to show the Navigation pane.\n  \n  \n  \n    Go to Common > Common > Global address book.\n  \n  \n  \n    Click New on the Action Pane at the top of the Party page.\n  \n  \n  \n    Under the General tab, complete the following fields:\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Field\n          \n          \n            Description and/or Action Required\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Party ID\n          \n          \n            Auto generated.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Type\n          \n          \n            Select either Organization or Person as appropriate.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Name\n          \n          \n            Type the name of the vendor.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Search name\n          \n          \n            Auto generated.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            DUNS number\n          \n          \n            Type the unique 9-digit Dun and Bradstreet number identifier, if known.

Management (CRRD)","Path::contents/Key_Components_of_Inventory_Management.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Key Components of Inventory Management\n    The diagram below highlights the key areas that compose Inventory Management in Integra\n    \n    IRC uses both counting journals and inventory adjustments to make the proper adjustments to on-hand inventory. All inventory journals are posted by authorized staff; this can be in-office Supply Chain or a warehouse manager.\n    Note: A counting journal is also used to account for breakage, theft, or loss of inventory.\n    Physical Inventory Counts\n    IRC has three different scheduled times where cycle counts are performed. These scenarios apply to CIK inventory as well.\n    Periodic inventory count (20% count): 20% of products existing are randomly chosen for inventory counting every two months. Products chosen will not repeat within the same year. Last count may be more or less 20%, it will be “count everything that has not yet been counted.” CRRD does a 20% periodic count and as of April 2021 RAI does a periodic count every 6 months.\n    Annual inventory count (100% count): A full inventory count is performed at the end of the fiscal year in the final days of September and warehouses are locked from 1-3 days depending on the country. All on-hand material is counted during an annual inventory count, including material procured for a grant/project and CIK/donated material.\n    End of grant count (100% count): Two months before a grant ends, all remaining products procured for a grant that are counted. This applies to all purchased material.\n    Note: A counting journal is also used to account for breakage, theft, or loss of inventory.\n    Inventory Adjustments\n    Inventory adjustments are made upon discovery of discrepancies; not just when the annual cycle count is completed. Adjustments may be required for the following scenarios:\n    \n      Disposal – Items are expired or damaged\n      Loss – It is discovered, while picking, that inventory is missing\n      Found – Material may be found and is added in to inventory\n      Item sampling – IRC receives samples of inventory from vendors in the RFP process. The IRC must keep the winning vendor’s samples for three years for audit purposes. Samples are recorded at zero cost and have no ledger impact\n    \n    If an inventory adjustment is substantial, there is the potential for an insurance claim to be made to help recoup the cost of the inventory loss/adjustment.\n    All inventory journals such as adjustments and counting journals are posted by Supply Chain to a holding account. Supply Chain will attach proof for the adjustment, where applicable.\n    Finance, in coordination with in-office Supply Chain or equivalent, executive director, etc., runs a report every two weeks to view all adjustment and counting journals. Finance evaluates the journals to account for any adjustments in inventory that will have a financial impact to the organization (i.e., spoilage uncovered during cycle count.) and will make financial adjustments as required.\n    Process Flow Diagram\n    \n    \n      Upon receipt of products, staff need to manage the on-hand inventory.\n      All tasks are managed in Integra except for the inventory count.

The system calculates the value for this column and updates it automatically.\n      If the number is less than the expected on-hand, the Quantity column displays a negative value. If the counted quantity is greater than the on-hand quantity, the Quantity field displays a positive value.\n      If there is a discrepancy between the on-hand and counted values, best practice is to perform a second count. The second count is a manual process and happens outside of the system and is not performed by the same person who did the original count. The warehouse personnel submits the second counted values to the supervisor. The supervisor enters the second count value in the Counted column, and this is the final count.\n    \n    \n      In the Worker column, for each item counted, enter the personnel number for staff who performed the count.\n        \n        Note: Click the drop-down arrow and search for the individual by name.

travel advance requests. Payment of the travel advance is also recorded in Integra.\n    Users create Travel Expense Reports (TERs) in Integra and submit them to their supervisors or department heads for online approval.\n    Clearly legible scanned receipts and any other documents and comments required for verification of expenses are attached to the expense reports in the system.\n    Creating Expense Reports Against Cash Advances\n    When submitting expense reports where there is an outstanding cash advance balance available, a Cash advance number field is displayed in the header of the expense report. Employees must select the relevant cash advance number from the drop-down selection list in this field. Subsequently, the Exchange rate field in the expense report is auto-populated with the exchange rate that was applicable at the time the cash advance was processed; not the exchange rate applicable at the time the expense report is submitted.\n    Notes and Guidelines: \n    \n      If the employee does not have any active cash advances, the Cash advance number field is not displayed in the expense report header.\n      Only one cash advance number can be referenced on a single expense report. That is, there is a 1:1 relationship between an expense report and a cash advance number.\n      Per IRC policy, an employee should “use up” the full amount of a cash advance balance before referencing a different/new cash advance number.\n      Once an expense report references a cash advance number, the balance of the cash advance is automatically updated to reflect the remaining balance.\n    \n    Create a Travel Advance Request (Cash Advance)\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to request a cash advance, ahead of scheduled travel, if required.\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      You know the project to be charged for the cash advance.\n      You do not have an outstanding advance.\n         \n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate modules to Expense management > My expenses > Cash advances.\n    \n    \n     \n    The Cash Advances page opens.

Management (RAI)","Path::contents/Inventory_Management_(CRRD)-copy.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Key Components of Inventory Management\n    The diagram below highlights the key areas that compose Inventory Management in Integra\n    \n    IRC uses both counting journals and inventory adjustments to make the proper adjustments to on-hand inventory. All inventory journals are posted by authorized staff; this can be in-office Supply Chain or a warehouse manager.\n    Note: A counting journal is also used to account for breakage, theft, or loss of inventory.\n    Physical Inventory Counts\n    IRC has three different scheduled times where cycle counts are performed. These scenarios apply to CIK inventory as well.\n    Periodic inventory count 50% count on March 31 and September 31.\n    Annual inventory count (100% count): A full inventory count is performed at the end of the year and warehouses are locked from 1-3 days, depending on the office.\n    End of grant count (100% count): Two months before a grant ends, all remaining products procured for a grant that are counted. \n    Note: A counting journal is also used to account for breakage, theft, or loss of inventory.\n    Inventory Adjustments\n    Inventory adjustments are made upon discovery of discrepancies; not just when the annual cycle count is completed. Adjustments may be required for the following scenarios:\n    \n      Items are expired or damaged\n      It is discovered that inventory is missing\n    \n    If an inventory adjustment is substantial, there is the potential for an insurance claim to be made to help recoup the cost of the inventory loss/adjustment.\n    All inventory journals such as adjustments and counting journals are posted by Supply Chain to a holding account. Supply Chain will attach proof for the adjustment, where applicable.\n    Finance, in coordination with in-office Supply Chain or equivalent, executive director, etc., account for any adjustments in inventory that will have a financial impact to the organization (i.e., spoilage uncovered during cycle count.)\n    Process Flow Diagram\n    \n    \n      Upon receipt of products, staff need to manage the on-hand inventory.\n      All tasks are managed in Integra except for the physical inventory count. \n      The physical count may be a segregated function from the recording and posting of the count results.\n    \n    Create Counting Journal\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to create a new counting journal for an annual inventory count in Integra.\n    Prerequisites\n    Not applicable.\n    Steps\n    \n      From the Integra Home page, navigate modules to Inventory management à Journal entries à Item counting à Counting.\n        \n      \n      Click New on the menu at the top of the page.\n        \n      \n      Complete/select the following fields/buttons:\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Field / Button\n            \n            \n              Entry/Selection Required\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Description\n            \n            \n              Enter a meaningful description to reflect the type of counting journal being created.\n              E.g., Annual Inventory Count - Sept. 2022.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Site\n            \n            \n              Select the relevant site from the drop-down selection list.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Warehouse\n            \n            \n              Select the relevant warehouse from the drop-down selection list.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Warehouse button\n            \n            \n              Toggle selector button to Yes.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Location button\n            \n            \n              Toggle selector button to Yes.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Project ID button\n            \n            \n              Toggle selector button to Yes.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Click OK to proceed.\n    \n    \n    \n      On the menu at the top of page, click Create Lines and select On-hand from the drop-down selection list.\n    \n    \n    \n      In the Create on-hand counting journal form, scrol down and expand the Records to include tab and click Filter.\n    \n    \n    \n      On the Item counting page, select the appropriate query and then click OK.\n      Click OK again to close the Create on-hand counting journal form.\n    \n    \n    \n      Review the results.

Receipt and Dispatch (RAI)","Path::contents/Receive_and_Dispatch_(RAI).htm::InnerText":"\n  Receiving - Business Process Information\n  This section outlines key terms and business process steps for the following:\n  \n    Receipt of non-stock products\n    Receipt of stock products\n    Receiving – General Information\n  \n  Receiving Products - General Information\n  \n  \n  When material arrives or services are delivered at an IRC location, Integra must be updated to record the receipt of the material. The receipt record is a prerequisite to invoice payment.\n  \n    Stock products are received and tracked inventory, i.e., on-hand balances are updated with each goods movement\n    Non-stock products are not tracked in inventory. Upon receipt of non-stock items, the items are immediately expensed to a project.\n  \n  Important: Services are received the same way non-stock items are received.\n  A partial quantity of a PO may be received. In these situations, the PO remains open until all items are received.\n     \n  Receipt of Non-Stock Products (and Services) - Business Process Flow\n  \n  Receipt of Stock Products - Business Process Flow\n  \n  Receipt of Capitalized Fixed Assets\n  When receipt of a capitalized fixed asset is posted in Integra, an asset record is automatically created for the item in the Fixed Assets module.\n  After the fixed asset record is created, Operations staff or Supply Chain must update the asset record with pertinent information, such as, technical specifications, image uploads, warranty information, etc.\n  Refer to the Fixed Assets section for detailed guidance on updating a fixed asset record:\n   \n  Enter Product Receipt (Items and Services)\n  Purpose\n  Use to procedure to record the receipt of items and services.\n  Note: If item is a capitalized asset, Supply Chain must update the fixed asset record with pertinent details after receipt is posted. This is done in the Fixed Assets module of Integra.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    PO Approval status is Confirmed.\n    Purchase order status is Open Order\n    Products have been physically received or services have been performed\n    Vendor’s delivery document confirming shipment/receipt has been received for items\n    Certificate of completion (or equivalent) has been received for completed services\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra home page, navigate modules to Procurement and sourcing  Purchase orders  All purchase orders.\n  \n  \n  \n    Find the relevant PO and click the PO number to open the PO form.\n  \n  \n    Note: There are various search filters that can be used to find the PO number.\n  \n  \n  \n    Review the information on the PO lines to ensure the correct PO was selected.\n    On the menu at the top of page, click Receive.\n  \n  \n  \n  Optional: Under PRINT OPTIONS section, click the Print product receipt indicator so it displays Yes (indicator turns blue). This enables printing of the receipt.\n  \n  \n    Under the Generate action pane, click Product receipt.\n      \n      Note: Always use Product receipt, even if you are receiving services.\n    \n    Under the Overview section, in the Product Receipt field, type a unique identifier, e.g., Bill of lading number, certificate of service completion, etc. If no equivalent exists, enter the PO number. This is a required field so something must be entered.\n    Use the scroll bar on the right to scroll down to the Lines section. (You may have to click Lines to expand the section).\n    In the receipt line, update the Quantity field with the actual quantity received.\n      \n      Note: The quantity defaults to the quantity on PO but a partial quantity may be entered if the delivered quantity is less than PO quantity. The PO will remain open until the full PO quantity is received.\n    \n    Click OK.\n      If print option was previously selected, the print view of the product receipt will automatically display.\n  \n  To print the receipt, click  (printer icon) and select the print destination.\n  Click the X in the top right corner of page to close the print view and return to the PO form.\n  \n  If the full amount of the PO was received, validate that the PO status has been updated to Received.\n  If a partial amount of the PO was received, validate that the PO status is still set to Open order.\n  Result\n  You have recorded the receipt of items or services. An invoice can now be created for the PO.\n  \n    If a signed receipt document needs to be attached to the PO, click the paperclip icon in the top right corner of the PO form and upload the document.\n    To view a list of all receipts posted against the PO, select Product receipt under the Journals action pane.\n    If you need to print/reprint the product receipt document, select Product receipt under the Journals action pane; select the relevant receipt document; click Preview/Print tab and select Copy preview.

Refer to the instructions in the Appendix of this guide titled, Attach Signed Packing List to Client’s Vendor Record.\n  \n  Result\n  You have generated a packing slip to be included with items being dispatched.\n  Attach Signed Packing List to Client’s Vendor Record\n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra home page, navigate the modules Accounts Payable > Vendors > All vendors.\n    Search for and select the client vendor record.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the top right corner of page, click the paper clip icon.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the menu at the top of page, click New and select File from the drop-down selection list.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the right-hand panel, click Browse.\n    Locate and select relevant document, as per standard Windows browsing functionality. (It may take a few seconds for upload to complete)\n  \n  \n  \n    Validate the attachment is listed in the left-hand panel.\n  \n  Note: If two distributions are required for the same D9, i.e., in cases where the principal applicant and someone within the principal applicant’s collection, both needed an item, enter a note in the Notes box that specifies the additional people.\n  \n    Click X in the right-hand corner of page to close the window and return to the previous screen.\n  \n  Result\n  You have uploaded (attached) a signed packing list to a client’s vendor record.\n\n","Path::contents/Receive_and_Dispatch_(RAI).htm::size":16315,"Path::contents/UG_Item_Forecasting_to_Purchase_Order_Creation_QA.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/integra-help.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/UG_Item_Forecasting_to_Purchase_Order_Creation_QA.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/integra-help.css"},{"origLink":"assets/images/UG_Item

Forecasting to Purchase Order Creation (CRRD)","Path::contents/UG_Item_Forecasting_to_Purchase_Order_Creation_QA.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Business Process Information\n    Key Messages\n    \n      The item forecast is used by CRRD for all project-related procurement planning.\n      Each project has their own item forecast.\n      An item forecast line is required for every product (items and services) that IRC expects to procure and distribute during the life of a project.\n      After the first upload of the Excel version of the item forecast to Integra, ongoing additions/changes are made directly in the Item Forecast page in Integra.\n      The item forecast is a “living document”; Programs and Supply Chain collaboratively create and maintain this document throughout the life of the project.\n    \n    Timing for Populating the Item Forecast\n    Regardless of the approval stage of a proposal/project, the steps for populating the Item Forecast Template are the same; the difference lies in “when” you do it.\n    \n      Proposal submitted to Donor and awaiting project approval (highly likely)\n    \n    \n      Written notification or Letter of Intent received from donor\n      Applies to follow-on projects that get renewed annually (where new D1 is assigned each year)\n        \n          Could potentially be a non-follow-up project where verbal notification has been supplied by Donor.\n        \n      \n      A project ID/D1 is assigned but spending cannot start until financing approval has been received from Donor and/or IRC. (and project has been activated in Integra).\n    \n    \n      Award has been approved by Donor\n    \n    \n      May or may not have received award agreement\n    \n    Process Flow - Item Forecast to Item Requirements\n    Outlined below are the key steps from item forecasting through to item requirement creation. The responsible roles for each step are indicated above the step number.\n    \n    Purchase Order Processing from Item Requirements\n    \n      Prior to creating a purchase order (PO), Supply Chain must validate that there is insufficient on-hand quantity* (reserved to the project) to fulfill the item requirement quantity. *\n      Supply Chain assigns a vendor to each sales order line and creates POs from the sales order lines. (The Integra system automatically generates a sales order line for each item requirement line.)\n    \n    * Notes:\n    \n      If  there is excess inventory of a required item on another project, those items may be unreserved from the project with excess inventory and transferred to the project that requires the items.\n      For instructions for transferring inventory from one project to another,  refer to the section, Inventory Transfers and Returns.\n    \n    Procedures\n    Items Not Procured using the Item Forecast\n    The following items are procured using purchase requisitions, not the item forecast.\n    \n      Capitalized fixed assets\n      Items using unrestricted funds\n      Shared program costs\n      Planson products\n    \n    For instructions on how to process these type of purchases, refer to the following sections:\n    \n      Procure to Confirm (PR-PO)\n      Fixed Asset Management\n    \n    Populate the Item Forecast Template\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to retrieve and populate the Item Forecast Template (Excel Format).\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Project has been approved or is “highly likely” to be approved.\n      Senior Management has given the “go ahead” to begin populating the template.\n      A copy of the budget with correct financial dimensions is at hand\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Download and open the most current Item Forecast template from Box.\n      When Excel file opens, click Enable content at the top of the screen.\n          Note: The first time you login to the template, you will be prompted with the window below, you must click Organizational account, click Sign in, then select your user account and click Connect.\n        \n      \n      Populate all required columns in the sheet titled, Item Forecasts.\n        Note: The key tabs for finding correct information to use are Project, Items, and Dimensions.\n      \n    \n    Important things to remember when populating the template:\n    \n      Always retrieve the most recent version of the item forecast template.\n      Ensure the product ID number selected is actually the correct number/description for the item being procured. That is, do not select an item that is just “similar’ to the required product. If the exact product cannot be found, send request to Supply Chain to create the product in the reporting entity.\n      Ensure the Description field is populated with the product name and any additional details/specs required for the product , as required.\n        Important: The Description field should always be populated with some description as this field provides the only descriptive text that is output on picking/packing lists. Otherwise, only the product ID is visible which does not provide enough information for SCM.\n      \n      If there are multiple required by dates for a given product, an item forecast line is created for each different “required by date”.\n      If there are multiple combinations of financial dimension values for a given product, an item forecast line must be created for each different combination of financial dimension values.\n      Always use the drop-down selection lists to select data, where available.\n      The ProductName field holds a maximum of 100 characters. If more than 100 characters are required, enter the full description in the Description column.\n      You can modify the Price column to reflect your most recent estimated price for the product (Guidance on the estimated price can be provided by the SC team)\n      Do not change the defaulting value in the SalesUnitOfMeasure field.\n      If item number is not known, enter 999999999 as a budget placeholder.*\n        \n          Select 999999999 in the ProductID field\n          Manually type a description in the Description field.\n          Enter the unit of measure and price and other required information.\n          Ask your Supply Chain colleagues to request the creation of the new product  \n          Item requirements cannot be created for item 999999999 so this field eventually needs to be updated with actual product ID (or multiple product IDs if necessary).\n        \n      \n    \n    *  Alternatively, leave this line out of the Item Forecast template until such time as a product number is available OR program staff have more specific information for products they want to procure.\n    \n      The required naming convention for successful upload is, Item Forecast [project ID]-[reporting entity]. \n    \n    Examples are:  “Item Forecast DF119-2SLE”, “Item Forecast DF129-2KEN”\n    \n      Standardized naming conventions have been developed for products for ease of searching and consistent reporting.  \n      Creating and updating the item forecast template is typically an iterative process, meaning that it will evolve as more details about procurement needs are identified\n    \n    Result\n    The item forecast template is complete and ready to upload to Integra.\n    Upload the Item Forecast Template to Box\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to upload the completed item forecast to Integra.\n    This procedure is performed by Supply Chain.\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      All required fields in the template have been completed correctly\n      Template is saved on local drive\n      Project exists in Integra\n      Template file has been named correctly for successful upload, i.e., with reporting entity suffix.\n        \n          E.g., “Item Forecast DF119-2SLE” ; “Item Forecast DF129-2KEN”\n        \n      \n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Open the target Box page.\n      Copy/upload file to Box location as per standard Box uploading procedures.\n      Copy/upload completed template to target Box folder.\n      Validate template was successfully uploaded to Integra.\n      After a few minutes, validate that file has disappeared from the Box location. This indicates that the file was uploaded to Integra.\n      An email will be sent to indicate success of upload. (And likewise if it failed.)\n    \n    Result\n    The item forecast has been uploaded to Integra to the Project management and accounting module.\n    Next Steps\n    Supply Chain validates the uploaded item forecast lines against the donor restriction table.\n     \n    Validate Uploaded Item Forecast Lines Against Donor Restricted Items\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to validate uploaded item forecast lines against the donor restricted items table.\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      The item forecast template has been uploaded to Integra or a new line has been manually added.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate modules to Project management and accounting > All projects.\n    \n    \n    \n      Search for, and open, the target project form.\n    \n    \n    \n      On the menu at the top of the project form, click Plan.\n    \n    \n    \n      Under the Forecast fast tab, click Item forecasts.\n    \n    \n    \n      On the menu above the table grid, click Validate lines.\n    \n    \n    \n      Review any donor restriction messages and take appropriate action.\n    \n    Notes: \n    \n      Lines with issues display a red X or a yellow exclamation point under the Validation check column.\n      If there are restrictions, one of the following two messages will display at the top of page.\n    \n    \n    Result\n    You have validated item forecast lines against the donor restrictions table.\n    Approve Item Forecast Lines\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to approve item forecast lines. This action represents an approval to proceed with procuring the item or service.\n    \n      Programs click Workflow > Submit to action the approval. After a short period of time (usually less than a minute), the line is auto-approved by the system as long as lines have been validated without errors.\n      Once an item forecast line is approved, an item requirement line is created in the project.\n    \n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Status of the item forecast line is “Draft”.\n      Draft lines have been validated without errors.\n      All placeholder lines have been removed an replaced with a valid product number.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate modules to Project management and accounting > All projects.\n    \n    \n    \n      Search for, and open, the target project form.\n    \n    \n    \n      On the menu at the top of the project form, click Plan.\n    \n    \n    \n      Under the Forecast fast tab, click Item forecasts.\n    \n    \n    A list of existing item forecast lines for the project is displayed.\n    \n      Click the selection circle next to the lines requiring approval. Multiple lines may be selected at once.\n    \n    Tip: Filter on the Status field to show only item forecast lines in Draft status.\n    \n      On menu at top of page, click the three dots and select Workflow > Submit.\n    \n    Note: If the three dots are not displayed, click Workflow on the menu at the top of page to perform the same action.\n    \n    \n      Confirm the status of the lines have changed to In review.\n    \n    Note: These lines will be auto-approved within a minute (approximately).\n    \n      Confirm that the status of the item forecast line(s) has changed to Approved.\n    \n    Result\n    You have approved item forecast line(s) and item requirements have been created for each approved line for further processing by Supply Chain.\n    Create an Item Forecast Line Directly in Integra\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to manually add a line the item forecast in Integra.\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      It has been verified that an item forecast line does not already exist for the requirement.\n      Financial dimensions are known.\n      If, applicable, the currency exchange rate has been configured in Integra.\n        \n          To view configured exchange rates, navigate modules to General ledger > Currencies > Currency exchange rate.\n          If a new exchange rate is required, contact Finance.\n        \n      \n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate modules to Project management and accounting > All projects.\n    \n    \n    \n      Search for, and open, the target project form.\n    \n    \n    \n      On the menu at the top of the project form, click Plan.\n    \n    \n    \n      Under the Forecast fast tab, click Item forecasts.\n    \n    \n    Note: A list of existing item forecast lines for the project displays.\n    \n      To add a new item forecast line, click New on the menu at the top of page.\n    \n    \n    A new line with status Draft is added to the table.\n    \n      Complete/review the following fields for the new item forecast line:\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Field\n            \n            Entry Required \n          \n          \n            Created By\n            This field defaults with the name of the person creating the item forecast line. \n          \n          \n            Status\n            This field displays the current status of the item forecast line.

This is typically required for item requirement lines that were generated as a result of an inventory quantity increase via a method other than receipt on a PO. These methods include:\n    \n      Any item movement journal (CIK and other)\n      Return from beneficiary\n      Positive inventory adjustment\n      Positive discrepancy on a counting journal line\n      Project to project inventory transfer\n    \n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Item forecast line was created and approved\n      Item requirement was auto-created from item forecast line\n      Batch number has been assigned to the item requirement line for FEFO/Batch Controlled items.

types of fixed assets managed in Integra at IRC.\n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Type of Asset\n            \n            \n              Description\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Capitalized Asset\n              (Depreciable asset)\n            \n            \n              An asset purchased with IRC unrestricted funds (U1000) or donated items that meet the capitalized asset criteria. These assets are capitalized and depreciated with prior approval from NY Finance and the regional unit.\n              The purchase cost of a capitalized asset is charged to the balance sheet.\n              The donated purchase cost of a capitalized asset is charged to the balance sheet.\n              Depreciation of a capitalized asset is charged to a project.\n              Example: A vehicle or generator is purchased for the Kenya office\n              IRC capitalized assets are recorded in Integra at their purchase cost and then depreciated.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Donor Asset\n            \n            \n              An asset purchased with donor funds. These assets are generally fully expensed to grants. There are different USD (or GBP and Euro) thresholds, acquisition, reporting, and disposal requirements for each donor.\n              The purchase cost of a donor asset is expensed directly to the project.\n              These assets are set up for tracking purposes only, with a penny value attached, and are not depreciated. The original cost is recorded on the asset record for reference purposes only.\n              Example: A donor pays for a vehicle.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              IRC Non-depreciable Asset\n            \n            \n              An asset charged to the donor, but not donor-owned.\n              The purchase cost of an IRC non-depreciable asset is expensed directly to the project.\n              Different donor organizations have different thresholds as to what they want to track as an asset.\n              These assets are set up for tracking purposes only, with a penny value attached, and are not depreciated. The original cost is recorded on the asset record for reference purposes only.\n              May be applicable to restricted, temporary restricted or unrestricted projects.\n              Example: A donor pays for a laptop, smartphone, etc. but the item does not meet their requirements to define it as trackable “asset” but IRC wants to track it as a non-depreciable asset.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              CIK Fixed Asset\n            \n            \n              An asset donated to IRC.\n              The donated value is recorded on the asset\n              CIKs are valued at their fair market value.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    Process Flow Diagrams (High-level)\n    Lifecyle of a Capitalized Fixed Asset\n    \n    Lifecyle of a Donor Fixed Asset\n    \n    The Fixed Asset Record in Integra\n    The fixed asset record contains all the information required to manage an asset in Integra. Fixed assets have a fixed asset group code assigned to them according to the nature and function of the asset. E.g., EQUIPFURN, VEHICLES, ARTPORT, LEASE.\n    The type of information included in the record (and related forms) includes, but is not limited to:\n    \n      Asset ID (auto-assigned by system)\n      Description\n      The asset group to which the asset belongs\n      Purchase cost of asset\n      Currency\n      PO number\n      Technical fleet information such as: make, model, serial number, year, etc.\n      Insurance information\n      Attached images of asset\n      Net book value\n      Depreciation profile\n      Status\n    \n    \n    Display a Fixed Asset Record in Integra\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to display a fixed asset record in Integra and identify key fields of information.\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Asset record exists in Integra.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate modules to Fixed assets >Fixed assets > Fixed assets.\n    \n    \n    \n      The Fixed assets page displays a table that lists all fixed assets for the selected reporting entity.\n    \n    \n      Use the Filter field to search for a specific asset.\n      Additionally, this table can be filtered on any column to narrow down display results for specific criteria, e.g., Filter the Fixed asset group column with value IVEHICLES to only display vehicle assets.\n    \n    \n      To open an asset record, click the asset number.\n    \n    \n    \n      The asset form is divided into multiple sections. Scroll down the form and click each section header to expand the section and review the information.\n      To view depreciation information, click Books on the menu at the top.\n      To view various values, e.g., NBV and depreciation amounts, click Valuations on the menu at the top.\n      Click X in the top-right corner to close the fixed asset form.\n    \n    Result\n    You have displayed a fixed asset record in Integra.\n    Display the Fixed Asset Listing Report\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to display a listing of all fixed assets for a reporting entity.\n    The report provides the following details and may be printed or downloaded.\n    \n      Fixed asset number\n      Fixed asset name\n      Fixed asset group\n      Book type\n      Status\n      Net book value\n    \n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Fixed assets exist in reporting entity.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate modules to Fixed assets > Inquiries and reports > Fixed asset listing report.\n    \n    \n    \n      Click Records to include to expand the section.\n    \n    \n    \n      To enter specific filter criteria, click Filter button.\n    \n    Note: If you do not want to enter any criteria, just click OK to proceed.\n    \n    \n      Under the Criteria column, enter any specific criteria, such as Fixed asset group, Fixed asset number, Book, etc.\n      Click OK to proceed.\n    \n    \n    \n      Click OK again to generate report.\n    \n    \n    \n      Review the report details.\n    \n    Note: The report may be downloaded or printed using the tool icons in the top-right corner.\n    \n      Click the X in the top-right corner to close the report and return to the Integra home page.\n    \n    Result\n    You have displayed the Fixed Asset Listing Report in Integra.\n    Creating and Updating Fixed Assets in Integra\n    The majority of assets are automatically created when receipt of a purchased asset is recorded in Integra. However, for CIK fixed assets, the asset record is created directly in the Fixed assets module.\n    Update Fixed Asset Record with Required Information\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to update the required information in a fixed asset record after it has been created in the system, e.g., vehicle specs, asset images, additional notes, etc.\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Asset record exists in Integra.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate modules to Fixed assets > Fixed assets > Fixed assets.\n    \n    \n    \n      Click an asset number to open the asset record form.\n    \n    \n    \n      Click Edit on the menu at the top of page.\n      Open each section of the form and update as required.\n    \n    Note: Vehicle specs such as license plate number, registration due date, ownership type, fuel capacity, and engine capacity must be entered in the Technical information section of fixed asset form.\n    \n      Once all required fields are complete, click Save and close the form.\n    \n    Result\n    You have updated a fixed asset record with required information.\n    Reverse a Fixed Asset Transaction\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to reverse a fixed asset journal.\n    Fixed asset journals are reversed due to errors and changes to the Fixed Asset record. Fixed asset transaction reversals reset fixed asset field values to their previous values.\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Transaction exists on fixed asset record.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate modules to Fixed assets > Fixed assets > Fixed assets.\n    \n    \n    \n      Select the fixed asset for reversal and click Books.\n    \n    \n    \n      On the fixed asset record screen, click Transactions.\n    \n    \n    \n      Select the transaction requiring reversal and click Reverse transaction.\n    \n    \n    \n      In the Transaction reversal screen, enter the reversal date in the Reversal posting date field and click OK.\n    \n    Result\n    You have reversed a transaction on a fixed asset record.\n    Create and Acquire a CIK Fixed Asset (Non-depreciable)\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to record CIK asset received at the IRC.\n    CIK fixed assets may or may not be assigned to a specific project.\n    \n      If asset is not assigned to a specific project, reference Project ID CK001 in the journal.\n      If asset is assigned to a specific project, reference the specific project ID.\n    \n    This procedure is divided into the following three sections:\n    Part I: Create fixed asset record for CIK item\n    Part II:Create fixed asset acquisition journal to assign $0.01 value to the asset\n    Part III: Create general journal to book the CIK revenue from donor\n    ‎\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Finance has received fair market appraisal value for donation from Supply Chain.\n         \n    \n    Steps\n    Part I: Create Fixed Asset Record\n    \n      Navigate modules to Fixed assets > Fixed assets > Fixed assets.\n    \n    \n    \n      On the menu at the top of page, click New.\n    \n    \n    \n      Update/complete the following fields:\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Field\n            \n            \n              Entry Required\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Fixed asset group\n            \n            \n              Select the following options depending on the asset.\n              CIKASSETNO -

There are key steps to follow to initiate the procurement of a donor asset.\n    Create a PR for a Capitalized Fixed Asset\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to create a PR for a capitalized fixed asset. IRC capitalized assets are recorded at their purchase cost and depreciated.\n    Important Transaction Details:\n    \n      The generic code U1000 is always entered in the D1 financial dimension field as capitalized assets are never charged to an actual project.\n      Since PRs for capitalized assets are not charged to a project, a project category is not required. However, to disable this field from being required, the U1000 D1 value must be removed on the Project tab in the line details section of PR, for every PR line. If it is not removed, the system will keep displaying the error message that a project category is required.\n      Reference the following standard UNSPSC codes in the Procurement category field in PR lines.\n    \n    \n    Prerequisites\n    \n      The standard UNSPSC codes have been set up as procurement categories.\n      Financial dimensions are known.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      From the Integra home page, navigate modules to Procurement and sourcing > Purchase requisitions > All purchase requisitions.\n    \n    \n    \n      On the toolbar at the top of the page, click New.\n    \n    \n    \n      In the right-hand information pane, complete/validate following fields:\n    \n    Note: For capitalized fixed asset PRs, do not enter a legal entity or Project ID because they do not get expensed to a project.\n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Field\n            \n            \n              Entry Required\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Name\n            \n            \n              Enter a meaningful description for the asset requisition.\n              Note: If creating PR on behalf of someone else, include the person’s name in the description.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Requested date\n            \n            \n              This field defaults to today’s date but may be updated to reflect desired delivery date.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Accounting date\n            \n            \n              Do not change the defaulting date.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Click OK to proceed.\n    \n    \n    \n      Click Add line to add a new PR line.\n    \n    \n    \n      Complete/validate the following fields:\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Field\n            \n            \n              Entry Required\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Item number\n            \n            \n              Do not enter a value in this field.

This action will remove the requirement of having to enter a subsequent project category. Project categories are not used on PRs for capitalized assets.\n    \n    Note: This step must be done for every PR line, otherwise the system will repeatedly display an error requiring the completion of the project category field.\n    \n      Attach any supporting documentation, e.g., quote for asset from vendor. Click the paperclip icon in the top corner of page to access the attachments screen.\n    \n    \n    \n      Once all required information has been entered in the PR, click Workflow on the menu at the top and click Submit.\n    \n    \n    \n      Enter any relevant comments for the approver and click Submit.\n    \n    \n    \n      Click the X in the top-right corner to close the PR form.\n    \n    \n      ‎Next Steps\n    \n      Finance reviews the PR and populates the Asset group field, which will carry over to the PO. (This field is located in the Line details section of PR, under the Fixed assets tab.)\n      Finance actions the workflow approval.\n      PR is routed for a second approval to D4 owner (RAI) or D5 owner - Country Director (CRRD).\n      Once fully approved, a PO is generated in the system (as long as vendor was entered on PR).\n      If a vendor is not entered on PR, the PR routes to GSC to populate vendor.\n      When receipt of asset is recorded in Integra, an asset record is automatically created for the item in the Fixed Assets module of Integra.\n      Supply Chain updates fixed asset record with required information. E.g., technical specs for vehicles.\n      Finance validates the fixed asset record by assigning the correct book, adding the useful life of the asset, etc.\n    \n     \n    Create a PR for a Donor Fixed Asset\n    Purpose\n    Important: This procedure is only relevant to RAI and HQ. Procurement of donor assets for CRRD is initiated from the item forecast function. Use this procedure to create a PR for a donor asset.\n    The majority of donor assets are procured from a vendor with whom IRC has an established agreement, so it is important to reference the agreement in the PR whenever possible.\n    Purchase of donor assets should never be split between projects.\n    It is the project category that drives the creation of a fixed asset record in Integra for the donor asset. Regardless of whether a project uses standard or unique project categories, the project categories will map to the main accounts and donor asset groups listed below.\n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Main Account\n            \n            \n              Main Account Description\n            \n            \n              Donor Asset Group\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              74101\n            \n            \n              <$5K IT Equipment\n            \n            \n              DITUNDR5K\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              74102\n            \n            \n              <$5K Other Equipment\n            \n            \n              DOTUNDR5K\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              74103\n            \n            \n              >=$5K Equipment & Furniture\n            \n            \n              DEQFOVER5K\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              74130\n            \n            \n              Vehicles Purchase\n            \n            \n              DVEHICLES\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              85000\n            \n            \n              CIK Asset (Non-Depreciable)\n            \n            \n              CIKASSETNO\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n     \n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Purchase agreement/vendor is known (if applicable)\n      All financial dimensions are known\n      Project category for asset must be assigned to project\n    \n    ‎\n    Steps\n    \n      From the Integra home page, navigate modules to Procurement and sourcing > Purchase requisitions > All purchase requisitions.\n    \n    \n    \n      On the toolbar at the top of the page, click New.\n      In the right-hand information pane, complete/validate the following fields:\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Field\n            \n            \n              Entry Required\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Name\n            \n            \n              Enter a meaningful description for the purchase requisition.\n              Note: If creating PR on behalf of someone else, include the person’s name in the description.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Requested date\n            \n            \n              This field defaults to today’s date but may be updated to reflect desired delivery date.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Accounting date\n            \n            \n              Do not change the defaulting date.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Select default project\n            \n            \n              Click the check box.\n              Important: This checkbox must always be selected in order to activate the Project ID field. which is a mandatory field.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Buying reporting entity\n            \n            \n              Select the relevant buying organization from the drop-down selection list.

For detailed instructions on using the DynAd journal, refer to the Journal Upload and Entry section in the Help files.\n    \n    Prerequisites\n    \n      The monthly depreciation proposal has been run.\n      Allocation amounts and target projects are known.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate modules to General ledger > Journal entries > General journals.\n      On the menu at the top of page, click New.\n    \n    \n    \n      In Name field, select DEP_ALLOC from drop-down selection list.\n      In the Description field, update description with meaningful text, e.g., Depreciation, [month].\n      On the menu at the top of page, click Lines.\n    \n    \n    \n      In the GL line, complete the following fields.\n        \n          Account: enter main account and all required financial dimensions\n          Description: Enter meaningful description.\n          Credit: enter full monthly amount of depreciation expense for the fixed asset\n        \n      \n      Click New to add new voucher line(s) for project(s) to which amount in ledger line is being allocated and complete the required fields:\n    \n    \n      Account type: Project\n      Account: Enter project ID\n      Category: Enter depreciation project category\n      Debit: Enter full monthly amount allocated to specific project.\n    \n    \n    Sample screenshot of completed voucher lines.\n    \n    \n      On the menu at the top of page, click Validate > Simulate posting.\n      Once posting simulation is successful, submit journal to workflow for approval.\n      Once approved, click Post to post the allocation journal.\n    \n    Result\n    You have allocated fixed asset depreciation to project(s).\n    Fixed Asset Disposals\n    Disposal - Capitalized Fixed Asset (Scrap)\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to dispose of capitalized fixed asset to Scrap.\n    At the time of Disposal-Scrap journal posting – acquisition cost and accumulated depreciation values are reversed. Residual net book value (NBV) is booked to main account 74220 (Loss on asset disposition) to record any loss or gain on disposal and is based on the posting profile configured for the fixed asset group assigned to the asset.\n    Note: In most cases, full depreciation of the asset would be completed before scrapping so there would be nothing to post to 74220 E.g., vehicles are depreciated over 3 years but are usually kept in excess of 3 years. It would only be in the situation of an accident and a car was written off that there would potentially be a loss.\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Net book value is known.

No transaction would be required except for confirmation of donor approval to enact the transfer\n    The Original project field on a project form field is used as a reference for users to track the history of a project including asset history when an asset is procured using donor funds and moved to another project for that same donor or another restricted donor funded project.\n    Example:\n    Year 1: Asset FA 0001 was bought with donor A funds under Project DF119.\n    Year 2: At the end of the grant, DF119 is closed out and Project DF221 is opened with donor A. Asset FA0001 will now be tracked under DF221 and Project DF119 will be listed as the original project.\n    Year 3: At the end of the grant, DF221 is closed out and Project DF474 is opened with donor A. Asset FA0001 will now be tracked under DF474 and Project DF119 will be listed as the original project.\n    Transfer Fixed Asset from One Project to Another\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to transfer a fixed asset from one project to another.\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Donor approval has been obtained (if applicable).\n    \n    Steps\n      ‎\n    \n      Navigate modules to Fixed Assets > Fixed assets > Fixed assets.\n    \n    \n    \n      On the action pane near the top of page, click Transfer fixed assets.\n    \n    \n    \n      Enter the following fields:\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Field\n            \n            \n              Description and/or Action Required\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Transfer date\n            \n            \n              If required, change the Transfer date.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Transfer comments\n            \n            \n              Enter the reason for the transfer\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Transfer to Financial Dimensions\n            \n            \n              Enter the new financial dimensions.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Click Update.\n    \n    \n    \n      Confirm From value and To value on Fixed asset transfer confirmation page.\n      Click Transfer.\n      Review transfer history.\n    \n    \n    \n    Result\n    A fixed asset has been transferred from one project to another project.\n    Next Steps\n    Update the Project association section in the fixed asset record.\n    Update the Project Association Table in the Fixed Asset Record\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to add a line in the Project association section of a fixed asset form. The project association tracks the history of where the asset has been used, e.g., original project.\n    Sample Scenario:\n    Fixed assets FA0001, FA0002 and FA0003 were procured with donor funds under project DF119. At the time of purchase order invoice, the fixed asset and project relationship is created on the fixed asset record. By default, when adding a line to the record, the fixed asset will only be “active” for the lifetime of the project. After the project ends, the relationship between the fixed asset and project does not disappear; it is kept for historical fixed asset tracking.\n    In the next year, project DF119 ends and DF221 is created. DF119 is marked as the Original project to project DF221. Since the project end-date for DF119 is already attached to the project and fixed asset relationship, this indicates that it is no longer active and no further action is required to remove DF119’s assets. Assets that will move to the new project DF221, will need to be associated with DF221 on the fixed asset form.\n    In the year after that, project DF221 ends and DF474 is created. The same process of recording DF474 as the follow on project and adding lines to the new project for assets association occurs.\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      A fixed asset was transferred from one project to another.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate modules to Fixed assets > Fixed assets > Fixed assets.\n      Open the fixed asset record.\n      Scroll down to the Project association section of asset form.\n    \n    \n    \n      To add a line to the table, click Add Line.\n      Populate the new line with required information to associate new project to which the asset was transferred. In the Original project field, enter the original project ID.\n    \n    Note: Lines can also be updated or removed.\n    Result\n    You have added a line in the Project association section of an asset form.\n    Reporting\n    The following reports are available for managing fixed assets.\n    Display the Project Asset List\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to view and report on donor fixed assets and usage on current and past projects. E.g., the project it was purchased for and all other follow-on projects the asset has been assigned to.\n    This information can be exported to Excel.\n    In the project form there is also a field labelled, “Original Project” that contains a drop-down list referencing all\n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Asset has been used on a project.\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate modules to Project management and accounting > Inquiries and reports > Project asset list.\n    \n    \n    \n      Review the information in the report.\n    \n    Result\n    You have displayed the project asset report.\n      ‎\n    Appendix\n    IRC and Donor Thresholds for Asset Classification\n    The table below outlines the different thresholds for asset classification according to organization/donor.

transfer order to transfer inventory from one IRC warehouse to another IRC warehouse, within the same Integra project.\n  This is a two-step process:\n  \n    Unreserve the quantity of the item being transferred from the sending warehouse to make it available for transfer\n    Create a transfer order to ship inventory from the sending warehouse to the receiving warehouse\n  \n  Important Tip: Performing this procedure works best with two concurrent sessions of Integra open.\n  Sending Warehouse Enters Product Receipt for Receiving Warehouse\n  There are situations in which the sending warehouse performs the product receipt steps for the receiving warehouse in Integra. In these situations, follow the steps in the following procedure Receive Product on a Transfer Order prior to saving and closing the transfer order.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    There is enough on-hand quantity of item being transferred to perform the transfer\n    It has been confirmed that the quantity of product to be transferred is available in the sending storage location\n  \n  Steps\n  Unreserve the Quantity of Product to Transfer\n  \n    From the Integra Home page, navigate the modules to Project management and accounting > Projects > All Projects.\n      \n    \n    On the All projects grid, in the Filter field, enter the project ID to which the item is associated.\n    Click the checkbox to the left of the line to select the project.\n    On the menu at the top, click Plan tab and under the Item requirements section, click Item requirements.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the list of item requirements, click the checkbox to the left of the item being transferred.\n    On the menu at the top of the page, click Manage and then click Inventory > Reservation.\n  \n  \n  \n    Click the Reservation field  and reduce the value by the quantity being transferred. a\n  \n  For example, if the current reservation reflects a quantity of 50, and 5 items are being transferred to another warehouse, the value in the Reservation field should be updated to 45.\n  \n  \n    Click Display dimensions to add inventory dimensions to the display.\n  \n  \n  \n    Click the checkbox next to each dimension to add.\n    Click OK to proceed.\n    Filter the display by the Project ID.\n    Locate the item reservation in the grid and select it for easy reference.\n  \n  Create Transfer Order\n  Note: Use a second concurrent session of Integra to perform this step by right clicking on the Integra internet tab and selecting Duplicate (per screenshot below).\n  \n  \n    In the second session of Integra navigate the modules to Inventory management > Outbound orders > Transfer order.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the menu at the top of pagae, click New to create a new order.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the Transfer order header section, in the OVERVIEW section, complete the following fields:\n  \n  \n

This ensures that costs appear correctly on the transfer journal.\n    Financial dimensions from originating PO are known.\n  \n  Full and Partial Quantity Transfer Scenarios\n  1. Transfer Full Quantity of Inventory from Sending Project\n  When transferring the full quantity of inventory from one project to another, the delivery remainder quantity on the sales order must be cancelled to make the quantity available for reservation on a different project. This is done by performing the following steps:\n  \n    On the Item requirements page, click Manage > Inquiries > Sales order. \n    Under the Sales order lines section, locate and select the relevant line item and click Update line > Deliver remainder. \n    On the Deliver remainder pane, click Cancel quantity.\n  \n  2. Transfer Partial Quantity of Inventory (when some inventory has already been distributed)\n  A quantity of the inventory has already been distributed and there is a remaining quantity available to be transferred. In this case, complete the same steps above for cancelling quantity of delivery remainder in sales order.\n  Tip: To determine whether any inventory for a specific product has already been distributed for a project click the Transactions tab for the item in the On hand list.\n  3. Transfer Partial Quantity of Inventory (where no inventory has been distributed)\n  In this case, the quantity to be transferred must be unreserved in the item requirements of the sending project (instead of cancelling the deliver remainder quantity on the sales order because the inventory is yet to be distributed.) This is done by performing the following steps:\n  \n    On the sending project, navigate to Item requirements > Manage > Inventory > Reservation.\n    On the relevant reservation line, reduce the quantity under the Reservation column by the quantity to be transferred.\n  \n  Steps\n  \n     Per the three scenarios listed above, either cancel the delivery remainder quantity on the sales order or unreserve the inventory on the item requirement line.\n    Navigate to Inventory management > Journal entries > Items > Transfer.\n  \n   \n  \n    On the menu at the top of page, click New.\n  \n   \n  \n     Validate/complete the following fields: \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Field \n        \n        \n          Entry Required\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Name          \n        \n        \n          This field defaults to INV_TRAN. \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Description\n        \n        \n          This field defaults to Inventory Transfer Journal.

Since a packing slip has been posted, the project has been expensed and the inventory is no longer available on-hand. To see the items in inventory in the warehouse, a return is processed. Beneficiary returns are processed with a negative item requirement.\n  When a negative quantity is entered on an item requirement, the return lot ID field is used to select the related packing slip for the return. Once the packing slip is posted, products are received back into inventory and the expense is reversed. If revenue had already been recognized for this item requirement distribution, upon next invoice proposal, a credit will be generated and the revenue will be reversed. That inventory is released by creating another item requirement to process the release.\n  Create a Return Order for Invoiced Items (to obtain credit from vendor)\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to create a return purchase order for products that were already invoiced by the vendor and get a credit for the returned products.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    The Approval status on original purchase order is Confirmed\n    The Purchase order status on original purchase order is Invoiced\n    The RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) number is known or original purchase order number known\n    For stock items, \"unreserve\" the quantity being returned \n      \n        Refer to the procedure, Reserve or Unreserve Quantity of Product in a Project\n      \n    \n  \n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra Home page, navigate modules to Procurement and sourcing > Purchase orders > All purchase orders.\n  \n  \n  \n    Find the invoiced purchase order on which the product is being returned and click the purchase order number to open the purchase order form.\n  \n  \n  \n    Review the information on the PO lines to ensure the correct PO was selected.\n  \n  Tip: Add the inventory dimensions to the table by clicking, Purchase order line > Display > Dimensions.\n  \n    Take note of, or copy, the purchase order number.\n  \n  Tip: Duplicate the session to display the initial purchase order for easy access to all the required information .\n  \n    Click New to create a new purchase order.\n  \n  \n  \n    Complete /validate the following fields on the Create purchase order form:\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Field\n          \n          \n            Entry Required\n          \n        \n        \n          Vendor section\n        \n        \n          \n            Vendor account\n          \n          \n            Enter the vendor account the product was purchased from and you are requesting the return from.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Pricing type\n          \n          \n            Default to Quote.

Client Payments","Path::contents/Setting_up_Clients_as_Vendors_in_Integra.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Setting up Clients as Vendors in Integra\n    In Integra, the details of all persons and organizations with whom the IRC interacts with are stored in the global address book. \n    The BENE vendor group relates to any person who is targeted for assistance, who directly benefits from, or comes in contact with, an IRC-implemented or financially-supported IRC program.  \n    Most clients are automatically created in Integra through the ETO (Efforts to Outcome) interface. However, non-ETO clients who do not need heightened confidentiality (i.e., their name being saved in Integra is acceptable) can be manually entered by the Master Data Management (MDM) team.\n    If the office has programs where clients require heightened confidentiality, a universal naming convention can be aplied to prevent the client's name from being entered into the system. Please follow up with your technical advisor for guidance on naming conventions. \n    The Client ID\n    \n      One client can have multiple client IDs if enrolled in multiple programs\n      When processing client payment requests, it is critical that the correct client ID is selected, as this is how Integra and ETO track what is spent on each collection and individual client.\n              \n      For client payments where the vendor selected is not the principal applicant, the client ID is the collection/case number. This number is linked to the principal applicant’s name.\n    \n     Business Process Flow\n    \n    Business Process Steps\n    \n      Caseworker enters client payment request in Client Payment Portal.\n      Caseworker submits payment request to workflow for approval.\n      Supervisor reviews the journal for accuracy. If everything is correct, the journal is approved and submitted to Finance. If errors are found, the supervisor must reject the journal so that the caseworker can make adjustments.\n      Finance posts the payment request and prints the RAI Client Journal. This is the receipt for client signature. The Receipt must be provided to the caseworker so that a signature from the client can be obtained in step 6.\n      Finance processes payment in Integra.\n    \n    \n      The client's date of birth is required for payment. Refer to the procedure in this section titled, Display List of Direct Assistance Cases, for instructions on finding this information.\n    \n    \n      Caseworker gives prepaid card (or check) to client (or vendor, when applicable) and obtains client's signature on hard copy printout of RAI Client Journal.\n      Caseworker saves electronic copy of signed journal in clien'ts digital Box folder or attaches it to the payment request journal in Integra.\n      Caseworker files hard copy in client’s folder.\n    \n    ‎\n    Recommended Follow-on Steps\n    \n      Caseworker validates that payment transferred to ETO.\n    \n    Display List of Direct Assistance Cases\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to determine/view the following:\n    \n      The list of clients that have come over from ETO, and in which programs they are enrolled. This helps determine the case number to use to process the payment request.\n      The invoice journals (payment requests) posted for a client.\n      The birth date of a client\n        \n          The finance manager requires the date of birth to load a customer card.\n        \n      \n    \n    ‎\n    Note: The table grid can be personalized to add/remove and move columns. Refer to the procedure directly after this procedure for instructions on personalizing a grid.\n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate to Project management and accounting  Projects  Direct assistance cases. You can also access this page by searching “Direct assistance cases” in the search bar at the top of the screen.\n    \n    \n    \n      A list of all cases is displayed for the legal entity. Review the information contained under each column. Scroll to the right to view all the columns.\n    \n    Note: The client’s date of birth is found in the Date of birth column (scroll to the right).\n    View the number and type of cases for a client\n    \n      To narrow down results to a specific client, filter on the Full name column.\n      Review all the individual case numbers related to that full name.\n    \n    View the invoice journals posted for a client\n    \n      Navigate to the Vendor account column in the grid. (Scroll to the right to see all columns)\n      Click a vendor account number to open the vendor master record.\n      On the action pane near the top of the form, under the Vendor tab, click Transactions to view a list of posted journals.\n    \n    Note: There will be two entries for each payment that has been completed. Those vouchers starting with “AP” reflect the invoice journals (initiated by caseworkers) and those with “PV” are those vendor payment journals completed by Finance used to process the client payment.\n    Result\n    You have displayed a list of clients and their enrollment programs. You have also viewed invoice journals (payment requests) posted for a client.\n      ‎\n    Create Client Payment Request on Mobile Client Payment Portal\n    Purpose\n    Use this procedure to enter a client payment request journal on the mobile client payment portal.\n    Each payment request journal requires two lines: a vendor line and a project line.\n    Attention:\n        \n         - If you are including multiple vendor lines in one journal (all using the same Client ID), each vendor line must have a corresponding project line.\n        \n        - Only one Client ID can be referenced on single journal. This is because the Client ID is now selected on the header level of journal and therefore applies to all lines in the journal.\n        \n        - Ensure you attach the client-signed document at the journal batch level, not on the individual journal voucher lines. \n    There are different financial dimension requirements for each line in the payment request journal:\n    \n      The vendor line requires the D1, D4, and D5. These populate automatically.\n      The project line requires the D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, and D6 financial dimensions.\n    \n    Prerequisites\n    \n      Client has a BENE vendor record set up in the Integra system. If a BENE vendor record does not exist for the client, contact the Master Data Management (MDM) team.\n      All required financial dimensions are known\n    \n    Steps\n    \n      Navigate modules to Accounts Payable > Invoices > Invoice Journals Mobile > Invoice Journal (Mobile).\n    \n      \n    \n      On the menu at the top page, click New to generate a new invoice journal.\n    \n     \n    \n       Complete the following header-level information:\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Field\n          Entry Required\n        \n        \n          Journal name\n          Select the relevant journal name for your office from the drop-down selection list.\n        \n        \n          \n            Description\n          \n          \n            Enter a description with specific details to help you identify the payment request more easily, i.e., client name, payment reason, date, caseworker’s initials. \n            e.g., Tang Cheng, Rental Assistance, ICM, June 2022\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Client ID\n          \n          \n            Enter the client ID for the client.\n            Important Notes: \n            \n              If you select a client ID that has expired, a warning message displays indicating that the client is not active. Contact Finance if the client ID needs to be reactivated.\n              Since the client ID is entered at the header level, only one client ID can be entered for the journal. This client ID is applied to all lines in the journal.\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Principle Applicant Name\n          \n          \n            This value defaults after the Client ID field is populated.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n      Carefully review all completed fields for accuracy. Due to the mobile funtionality of this transaction, it is difficult to make changes to this information after you click OK.\n      Click OK to proceed.\n    \n      \n    \n      Validate that the new journal is highlighted and displayed at top of list. (Newest journals always display at top of list.)\n    \n    Tip: To display only journals created by you, click the checkbox next to Show user-created only. \n    \n      Click the Lines tab to proceed.\n    \n      \n    \n      Click New. \n    \n      \n    \n      Complete the following fields for the vendor line:\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Field\n          \n            Entry Required\n          \n        \n        \n          Vendor account number\n          \n            Click the drop-down arrow and select the client's vendor account number.\n            Tip: To search the list, click the Search name column header to bing upa search filter window and enter the last nae of the client. If you select the search option, \"Contains\", you can search by first or last name.\n            Important: If paying a vendor on behalf of a client, enter the account number by searching for the name of the vendor you are paying, e.g., Walmart or landlord.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Invoice\n          \n          \n            Enter a unique invoice number.\n            Note: Each payment, regardless of whether it is to the same client, requires a unique invoice number. The standard format to use is the client’s initials and the date.\n            Example:\n            CT June 2022\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Purpose (Description)\n          \n          \n            This is a free text field that allows you to enter a longer description.\n            Enter a clear description of what the payment is for.\n            This is the description that prints on the voucher.\n            Example:\n            Rental assistance for ICM Client, 123 Apple Road, Apt. 1E\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Method of Payment (Posting profile)\n          \n          \n            Click the drop-down arrow and select the type of payment issuance. E.g., PREPCARD (Prepaid card).\n            Important: Selecting the correct method of payment is critical in ensuring the correct G/L account gets updated. Options GENAP or PREPCARD are the only options that should be selected.\n            \n              For any payments to a 3rd party (including rent to landlords or shopping for a client at Walmart), always use GENAP.\n              If check is being issued direct to client, use GENAP.\n            \n            For all prepaid payment cards, use PREPCARD, e.g., for “pocket money”.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Vendor amount\n          \n          \n             \n            Enter the amount being paid to the client.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n      Click OK to proceed.\n    \n      \n    The vendor line entry is displayed.

Ideally your program utilizes ETO to house minor clients – this is typically in the Youth, Workforce Development or Safety and Wellness Workspaces. If this is the case, the minor client is created via the ETO/Integra interface and appears on the Direct Assistance Case Table.\n          \n        If your program does not utilize ETO, then the minor client must be manually created by your office’s local finance manager on the Direct Assistance Case Table. It is ONLY the local office finance manager who is allowed to add clients to the Direct Assistance Case Table.\n           \n        In both of the above instances, as the minor client is under the age of 18, no vendor record is created.\n           \n        In most cases, when working with a minor client, payments are made to a responsible guardian, caretaker, or sponsor. When this happens, the guardian, caretaker, or sponsor must be created as a vendor in Integra. This is done by emailing TRADEVENDOR.CREATION@RESCUE.ORG and providing the following information:\n          \n          \n            First Name\n            Last Name\n            Date of Birth\n            Address – not required but strongly recommended \n          \n        \n      \n       \n      \n        Once the minor client is on the Direct Assistance Case Table and the vendor is appearing on the All Vendors page, follow the steps starting on page 8 to process the request for a payment to a client.\n           \n        If there is a programmatic reason not to make the payment to a responsible guardian, caretaker, or sponsor, and instead, payment must be made directly to the minor child, select the generic client record as the vendor (e.g., Atlanta Client) on step 9 of the Create Client Payment Request procedure in this guide. All other steps of this procedure remain the same.\n           \n        As long as the correct ETO Program is tagged to the project ID and the correct client ID is selected, this transaction should flow over to ETO, the same as any third party payment.\n      \n    \n    \n

Receipt and Dispatch (CRRD)","Path::contents/Receive,_Quality_Inspection,_Dispatch,_Transfers,_Returns_(CRRD).htm::InnerText":"\n  Receipt and Quality Inspection - Business Process Information\n  Business Process Flow Diagram\n  \n  Documents Processed in Receiving Process\n  The procedures below specify the sequence for first in first out (FIFO) and first expiry first out (FEFO) items in CRRD:\n  \n    Receipts list – Inventory personnel post a Receipts List when the product is received from the supplier. The Receipts List does not have an impact on financials or physical inventory.\n    Quality order – Once the Receipts List is posted, a Quality Order is automatically generated. A quality inspection is performed and results recorded. The quality inspection is performed by technical personnel from the requesting department.\n    Product Registration – All stock items (FIFO and FEFO) need to be registered to the correct location by Supply Chain personnel, i.e., change from Receiving location to actual location items will be stored. Pharmacy items are assigned a vendor batch number and food items are assigned a system batch number. \n    Product receipt – A Product Receipt is recorded and posted. This is a prerequisite to invoice processing and three-way match. The posting of the product receipt updates physical inventory (for stock items) and financials.\n  \n  Important: When products, that were initially received/posted at a port of entry, arrive at the IRC warehouse, a Transfer Journal must be processed to record the transfer to the actual storage location inside IRC warehouse where the product has been physically stored.  \n  General Information for Receiving Stock Items\n  All stocked items go through inspection and receipt upon arrival at an IRC location. They will be quality controlled for all CRRD legal entities and some RAI entities. When material arrives or services are delivered at an IRC location, Integra must be updated to record the receipt of the material.  The receipt record is a prerequisite to invoice payment. \n  Stock products are received and tracked in inventory. i.e., on-hand balances are updated with each product receipt.\n  A partial quantity of a PO may be received. In these situations, the PO remains open until all items are received.\n  Important: Services are received the same way non-stock items are received.\n  Delivered Products that Fail Quality Inspection\n  Procedures\n  Display On-hand Inventory\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to verify quantities of on-hand inventory associated for each stock product received into inventory. \n  \n  You can also view all transactions processed for a specific item, such as purchase orders, sales orders, inventory adjustments, etc.\n  Important Tip: It is very useful to always have this report open in a separate Integra session while doing any transactions that affect inventory so you can validate if inventory levels are updating correctly.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    The item has been set up as an inventory item in Integra.\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra Home page, navigate the modules to Inventory management > Inquiries and reports > On-hand list.\n  \n  \n  \n    Apply any or all of the following filters by selecting the drop-down list for more filtering options: \n  \n  \n    Item number \n    Site \n    Warehouse \n    Project ID\n  \n  Note: If additional filters are needed, click the Add button to select other values. \n  \n    Click Dimensions on the menu at the top of the page to add additional inventory dimension values to the on-hand inquiry display.\n  \n  \n  \n    Click the checkmark next to the dimensions to display in the relevant selections. E.g., Site, Warehouse, Location, Project ID, Batch number and Item number.\n    Click OK to proceed.\n  \n    \n  \n    Click Apply  on the left-hand Filters pane to retrieve results.\n  \n    \n  \n    Review the results of on-hand inventory displayed in the On-hand grid. \n  \n  Tips:\n    - Refer to the topic, On-hand List - Column Descriptions, for explanations of each of the columns displayed in the report.\n    - Click the filter icon in the Filter pane to collapse or expand the Filters pane, as required.\n  \n    To view all transactions associated with an item, select a line and click Transaction details on the menu at the top of the page. E.g., view purchase order numbers or journal numbers.\n    Click X to close the On-hand List report when reviewing is complete.\n  \n  \n  Result\n  You have viewed the On-hand List for inventory items. \n  Generate Receipts List\n  Purpose\n  Warehouse personnel use this procedure to generate a receipts list for stocked products received at an IRC location.\n  Note: Prior to beginning the procedure, first determine if the PO lines are for stocked or non-stocked products. \n  The receipts list is a system acknowledgement of accepting delivery and is akin to signing for a package. Entering the receipt list does not impact inventory balances.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    PO Approval status is Confirmed\n    Purchase order status is Open Order\n    Products have physically arrived at an IRC location or port of entry\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra Home page, navigate modules to Procurement and sourcing > Purchase orders > All purchase orders.\n  \n  \n  \n    Find the relevant purchase order and click the PO number to open the PO form.\n  \n  Note: There are various search filters that can be used to find the PO number. Refer to the Navigate Integra eLearning and Process a Purchase Order eLearning for filtering and filtering to find a purchase order.\n  \n  \n    Review the information on the PO lines to ensure the correct PO was selected.\n  \n  Ensure the items on the PO are stocked items before proceeding.\n  Tip: You can also add the Warehouse and Location columns directly to the table grid by clicking Purchase order line > Display > Dimensions and selecting the desired dimensions.\n  \n    On the menu at the top of page, click Receive.\n  \n  \n  \n    Under the Generate action pane, click Receipt lists.\n  \n  \n  \n    Under the Settings section, toggle Print receipts list to Yes to print the receipts list, if required. \n  \n  Note: The receipt list may be printed and signed by IRC and provided to the driver that they are receiving the products on the list.\n  \n  \n    Scroll down to the Lines section.

A quality order is automatically generated when a receipts list is created. For every received line in the Receipts list, a corresponding quality ordr is generated. For example, if five item lines were generated on the receipts list, the system creates five quality orders.\n    On the Receive tab, under the Journal section, notice the Receipts list journal is now available. The journal can be viewed and printed.\n    On the purchase order Header, under the General section, the Document status field is updated to display Receipts list.\n  \n  \n  \n    Validate the status of the PO status remains Open order.\n  \n  Note: Completing the Receipts list does not change the purchase order status.\n  \n    Click the X in the top right corner to close the purchase order.\n  \n  Result\n  You have posted the Receipts list for stock products delivered to an IRC location (or port of entry). A quality order and product receipt can now be completed.\n  Complete Quality Order after Inspection\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to complete a quality inspection order for all applicable stock products arriving at an IRC location. The quality order is automatically generated once the Receipts list is created.\n  Important Information:\n  \n    If some items fail inspection, the failed quantity must be blocked from inventory and a Non conformance created. This must be done before the quality order is validated.\n    Programs staff may monitor a list of all quality orders requiring action by navigating to: Inventory management > Periodic tasks > Quality management > Quality orders.\n  \n   \n  Prerequisites\n  \n    PO Approval status is Confirmed\n    Purchase order status is Open Order\n    Products have physically arrived at an IRC location and the receipt list has been posted\n    A Receipts List has been created\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra Home page, navigate modules to Procurement and sourcing > Purchase orders > All purchase orders.

Posting the packing list removes the quantity picked from inventory and expenses it to the project.\n  Receive CIK Inventory Items\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to record the receipt of CIK items into inventory. This only applies to CIK items that are tracked in inventory. E.g., large and/or high value items.\n  Note: Receipts are not entered for non-inventory CIK items as they are only tracked at the point of distribution.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    CIK item has been set up as an inventory item in Integra.\n    If receiving CIK items under a donor project (versus a CIK project such as CK001), consult with Finance for the correct financial dimensions, i.e., D1 to D6, and D11, D12. \n  \n  Important: Always consult with Finance for correct financial dimensions and market price requirements.\n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra home page, navigate the modules Inventory management > Journal entries > Items > Movement.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the menu at the top, click New.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the Name field, select CIK_In_Mov from the drop-down selection list.\n  \n  Note: When CIK_INV_MO is selected, the Offset account field is automatically populated with account 41600.\n  \n    Click OK to proceed.\n  \n  \n  \n    Under the Journal lines section, click New to add a new journal line.\n  \n  \n  \n    Complete the following fields for the journal line:\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Field\n          \n          \n            Entry/Selection Required\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Item number\n          \n          \n            Enter the CIK item number or click the drop-down arrow to perform a search for the item.\n            Note: Ensure the item description starts with CIK.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Product name\n          \n          \n            This value defaults after the item number is entered.\n            Note: CIK items begin with “CIK” in the product description.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Quantity\n          \n          \n            Enter the quantity being received.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Cost price\n          \n          \n            Enter the price of the CIK item being received.\n            Additional Notes:\n            Cost price should be entered based on the price given by the donor.\n            If the donor did not give a price, IRC will need to calculate the fair market value. Market value will be calculated following IRC’s internal policies.\n            Cost price is always in the legal entity accounting currency which is USD for all entities. Market value will be calculated following IRC’s internal policies.\n            If the fair market value is given to IRC in a different currency, this needs to be a manual calculation to convert to USD.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Cost amount\n          \n          \n            This value defaults based on the auto-calculation of cost price X quantity.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Scroll down to the Line details section and click the Financial dimension tab.\n  \n  \n  \n    Enter/validate the following financial dimension fields.\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Field\n          \n          \n            Entry/Selection Required\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Project ID (D1)\n          \n          \n            If items received are for a specific project, enter the specific D01 project ID.

(It appears in a light blue bar near the top of the page.)\n    Create an item forecast line for each CIK item received and perform \"marking\" for each item requirement line that gets created.\n  \n  IMPORTANT: Step 16 is mandatory in order to perform  subsequent distribution of the CIK stock items. Refer to the following procedures in the Item Forecasting to PO Creation section for guidance,\n  Create an Item Forecast Line Directly in Integra\n  \n    If items are going to different locations, a separate item forecast line should be created for each location.\n  \n  Perform \"Marking\" for an Item Requirement Line\n  \n    Important: If items are FEFO, before marking the item, update the Batch number field on the Product dimensions tab of the item forecast line. \n  \n  Result\n  You have recorded the receipt of CIK stock items into inventory and reserved and marked the items to the project.\n  Next Steps\n  Once CIK stock items are ready to be distributed, refer to the following procedures in this user guide: \n  \n    Generate a Picking List (Programs)\n    Post a Packing Slip (Supply Chain)\n  \n  Update Purchase Order Quantity via Request Change Function\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to change a purchase order after it has been approved.\n  Example:\n  A quantity of purchase order shipment from the vendor did not not pass quality inspection and the vendor cannot provide replacement items. In this case, the quantity on PO must be reduced to reflect only the quantity of items that passed inspection.\n  Prerequisites\n  Purchase order has been approved and/or confirmed.\n  Steps\n  \n    Navigate modules to Procurement and sourcing > Purchase orders > All purchase orders.\n    Select and open the relevant purchase order.\n    Click the Purchase order tab on the top menu.\n  \n    \n  \n    Under the Maintain section, click Request change  to make a change to the order.\n  \n  Note: Once you click Request change on an order that has a status of Confirmed, the status returns to Draft.\n  \n    In the Quantity field, update the quantity to the number of items that passed inspection.\n  \n  Note: Validate/update the price on the line as sometimes it disappears after changing the quantity.\n  \n    Click Save  to save the update.\n    Click Workflow > Submit to resubmit the purchase order for approval.\n  \n  Note: After the purchase order is approved, it requires confirmation again. This step is performed by Supply Chain. Once this step is complete, the purchase order status will return to Open Order and the approval status will return to Confirmed.\n  Result\n  You have changed a purchase order using the \"Request Change\" function. an invoice can now be processed for the purchase order.\n  On-hand List - Column Descriptions\n  \n    \n      \n        Column Name\n         \n      \n      \n        Physical

\n  * For RAI and HQ, the PR approver is the D4 owner – the budget holder. \n  * For CRRD, the PR approver is the D5 owner – the country director.\n  \n    Shared program costs route to the D4 owner for approval\n    Any PR that has a D1 of U1000 routes to the D4 owner for review and then to the D5 owner for final approval. i.e., for capitalized fixed assets and unrestricted procurement\n  \n   \n  Purchase Requisition Creation - General Information\n  A purchase requisition (PR) is an internal document that authorizes a procurement staff member to buy items or services based upon approval of the requisition.\n  Purchase requisitions have a defined purchase requisition approval workflow which controls the approval process of the purchase requisition from the time it is submitted to the workflow until it is approved by all users in the approval flow.\n  \n    For all RAI offices and HQ, purchase requisitions can be raised by anyone at the IRC. Most departments at HQ and RAI offices have decided to have only one or two people create PRs. Purchase requisitions are created for both items and services.\n    For CRRD offices, PRs are only used for procurement of capitalized fixed assets, shared program costs, any procurement charged to U1000, and Planson products. There is a very small group of people designated to create PRs in CRRD offices.\n  \n  Purchase requisitions are internal documents used to initiate the procurement process for products such as computer equipment, client bulk items, and consultancy firms. Please note, many procurement transactions performed in RAI offices are done using a P-Card and are routed through the Integra Expense Management module. This process is covered in the Expense Management training user guide. Pcard spend is subject to RAI procurement threshholds.\n  Note: For HQ and RAI (US), procurement of office supplies is done through Amazon Business. Information and instructions can be found on the following RescueNet page.

For further guidance, refer to the following document on RescueNet: Methods of Procurement Table.\n  All offices/departments must liaise with Global Supply Chain when adding or changing Integra data or records associated with a trade vendor to procure goods or services.\n  Information Required before Creating PR\n  \n    Project ID\n    Item number\n    Quantity\n    Vendor account number (if known)\n    Project category (Click the RescueNet link for How to Select the Correct D2 Code)\n    Inventory dimensions (Site, Warehouse, Location (if applicable))\n    Financial dimensions (D1 through D6)\n    Supporting documents to attach to PR\n  \n  Requesting the Creation of a Trade Vendor in Integra\n  To submit a request for the creation of a vendor record in Integra, follow these steps to complete the Integra Support Form:\n  From the RescueNet home page click the Support Hub menu at the top of page and navigate to Tech Resources > Integra.\n  On the Integra: Training and Support page, scroll down to the Integra support section and click the Get Integra Help button.\n  \n  Complete the Integra Support Form and submit.\n  \n    ‎Sourcing Contractors and Independent Consultants\n  From the RescueNet home page click the HR Center menu at the top of page and navigate to Benefits and Well Being > HR Center Home.\n  On the Global Human Resources page, click Individual Consultants in the directory list on the left-side of page.\n  \n  On the Engaging Consultants / Independent Contractors page follow the instructions listed on the page.\n  Create a PR (without purchase agreement)\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to create a PR when there is no purchase agreement in place with the vendor.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    It has been validated that a purchase agreement does not exist with the vendor.\n    The item or service record exists in Integra.\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra home page, navigate modules to Procurement and sourcing > Purchase requisitions > All purchase requisitions.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the toolbar at the top of the page, click New.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the right-hand information pane, complete/validate the following fields:\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Field\n          \n          \n            Entry Required\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Name\n          \n          \n            Enter a description for the purchase requisition.\n            Note: If creating PR on behalf of someone else, include the person’s name in the description.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Requested date\n          \n          \n            Defaults to today’s date but should be updated to reflect the date delivery of the item/service is required.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Accounting date\n          \n          \n            Leave default date.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Select default project\n          \n          \n            Click the check box.\n            Important: This checkbox must always be selected in order to activate the Project ID field. which is a mandatory field.\n            Exception: For capitalized fixed assets, this checkbox should not be selected.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Buying legal entity\n          \n          \n            Select the relevant buying organization from the drop-down selection list.

Also, if creating PR on behalf of another person, enter this information here.\n    Click Submit in bottom right corner of approval pane. You are returned to the PR form. The PR number is displayed in the top left section of PR form.\n  \n  Note: A draft PO is automatically created when a PR is fully approved (and a vendor was assigned).\n  Result\n  \n    The PR has been submitted for approval and approver will be notified.\n    The PR approval status can be viewed under the Status column on the All purchase requisitions page.\n    Once PR is fully approved and has a Closed status (and a vendor has been applied to the PR line), a draft PO is automatically created. The PO must then be reviewed, sent for workflow approval, confirmed after approval, then output to vendor. \n      \n        One PR can generate multiple POs (based on the number of vendors assigned to the PR lines)\n      \n    \n  \n  Note: If the approver does not act on (i.e., approve or reject) a PR within six (6) calendar days of receiving the PR it will be automatically rejected. The PR Creator will be informed by email and prompted to resubmit the PR to workflow. When resubmitting the PR, it is highly recommended that PR Creator contact the Approver to request that they act on it.\n  Tip: To learn how to personalize the layout of the PR lines table grid, e.g., add/remove columns or move columns around, refer to the RescueNet document titled, Personalize Table Grid Layouts.\n  Create a PR (with purchase agreement)\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to create a PR that references a purchase agreement.\n  The key differences when creating a PR that references a purchase agreement versus one that doesn’t are the following:\n  \n    The Pricing type selected on the initial PR creation pane must be Contract (vs. Quote).\n    The vendor and unit price for item/service defaults from the agreement.\n  \n  Important Reminder: All offices/departments must liaise with Global Supply Chain when adding or changing Integra data or records associated with a trade vendor to procure goods or services. This includes trade vendor records, products (items) and purchase agreements, regardless of spend, and to draft statements of work with an existing trade vendor.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    Purchase agreement for product/vendor exists in Integra\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra home page, navigate the modules to Procurement and sourcing > Purchase requisitions > All purchase requisitions.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the toolbar at the top of the page, click New.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the right-hand information pane, complete/validate the following fields:\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Field\n          \n          \n            Entry Required\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Name\n          \n          \n            Enter a description for the purchase requisition.\n            Note: If creating PR on behalf of someone else, include the person’s name in the description.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Requested date\n          \n          \n            Defaults to today’s date but may want to enter date when you wish to receive the product(s).\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Accounting date\n          \n          \n            Do not change the defaulting date.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Select default project\n          \n          \n            Click the check box.\n            Important: This checkbox must always be selected in order to activate the Project ID field. which is a mandatory field.\n            Exception: For capitalized fixed assets, this checkbox should not be selected.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Buying legal entity\n          \n          \n            Select the relevant buying organization from the drop-down selection list.

Procurement of donor assets for CRRD is initiated from the item forecast function.\n  Use this procedure to create a PR for a donor asset.\n  The majority of donor assets are procured from a vendor with whom IRC has an established agreement, so it is important to reference the agreement in the PR whenever possible.\n  Purchase of donor assets should never be split between projects.\n  It is the project category that drives the creation of a fixed asset record in Integra for the donor asset. Regardless of whether a project uses standard or unique project categories, the project categories will map to the main accounts and donor asset groups listed below.\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Main Account\n          \n          \n            Main Account Description\n          \n          \n            Donor Asset Group\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            74101\n          \n          \n            <$5K IT Equipment\n          \n          \n            DITUNDR5K\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            74102\n          \n          \n            <$5K Other Equipment\n          \n          \n            DOTUNDR5K\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            74103\n          \n          \n            >=$5K Equipment & Furniture\n          \n          \n            DEQFOVER5K\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            74130\n          \n          \n            Vehicles Purchase\n          \n          \n            DVEHICLES\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            85000\n          \n          \n            CIK Asset (Non-Depreciable)\n          \n          \n            CIKASSETNO\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n   \n  Prerequisites\n  \n    Purchase agreement/vendor is known (if applicable)\n    All financial dimensions are known\n    Project category for asset must be assigned to project\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra home page, navigate the modules to Procurement and sourcing > Purchase requisitions > All purchase requisitions.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the toolbar at the top of the page, click New.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the right-hand information pane, complete/validate the following fields:\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Field\n          \n          \n            Entry Required\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Name\n          \n          \n            Enter a meaningful description for the purchase requisition.\n            Note: If creating PR on behalf of someone else, include the person’s name in the description.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Requested date\n          \n          \n            This field defaults to today’s date but may be updated to reflect desired delivery date.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Accounting date\n          \n          \n            Do not change the defaulting date.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Select default project\n          \n          \n            Click the check box.\n            Important: This checkbox must always be selected in order to activate the Project ID field. which is a mandatory field.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Buying reporting entity\n          \n          \n            Select the relevant buying organization from the drop-down selection list.

This will update the PR status from In review to Draft, so that changes can be made.\n    Make changes as required.\n  \n  \n    Update select fields as required.\n    To remove a PR line, select the line item(s) and click Remove.\n    To delete an entire PR, click Delete on the menu at the top of the page.\n  \n  \n    ‎If updates were made to PR, resubmit PR to approval workflow.\n  \n  ‎\n  Result\n  \n    The PR was recalled from Workflow.\n  \n  Business Process - Purchase Orders\n  This section outlines key terms and the business process steps for:\n  \n    Creating a Purchase Order (PO) for an Individual Consultant/Contractor not associated with a temporary agency.\n    Submitting a PO for approval\n    Confirming an approved PO\n  \n  Important Notes:\n  \n    A draft PO is automatically created once a PR (with a vendor assigned) is fully approved.\n    A PO should never be created manually when purchasing a product.\n    The only scenario where a PO is created directly, without a PR, is for an Individual Consultant/Contractor not associated with a temporary agency.\n  \n  Business Process Flow\n  \n  Purchase Orders - General Information\n  A purchase order (PO) defines the goods/services, quantities, prices, discounts, payment terms, date of performance or shipment, other associated terms and conditions, and identifies a specific vendor. Once the PR is reviewed and approved by the D4 owner (RAI, All HQ) or D5 owner (CRRD), it becomes a draft purchase order.\n  The requestor manages and updates the PO and submits it for approval. Workflow approval follows a defined workflow approval process depending on an individual’s authority level as per the IRC Authorization Matrix.\n  Once a PO is fully approved, it is returned to the requestor. The requestor must then “confirm” the PO in Integra. The PO is then submitted to vendors by mail or email.\n  Important Note: For CRRD and RAI, it is typically Supply Chain or Operations staff who manages POs and submits them for approval and comfirms them.\n  Review Purchase Order and Submit for Approval\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to submit a completed PO for approval.\n  Note: To find the PO number from within the PR, navigate to the Line details section of the PR and click the Details tab. The purchase order number is displayed in this view. Clicking the hyperlinked PO number will open the PO form.\n  IMPORTANT TIP: You can customize the Purchase order lines table by adding columns and moving columns around for clearer visibility of information. Some useful columns to add to the PO lines table include: Warehouse, Location, Currency. If you customize a table, you can save the updates you made as a customized view. Please refer to the following document on RescueNet for instructions on customizing table layouts in Integra.\n  How to Personalize a Grid Layout in Integra\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    PO has status Draft.\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra home page, navigate modules to Procurement and sourcing > Purchase orders > All purchase orders.\n  \n  Note: If PO number is unknown, refer to the note above under the Purpose section for instructions on how to access the PO from the PR.\n  \n  Note: Ensure the view, Purchase Order List Page view is active. If not, click the drop-down arrow to select it and pin it as your default view. This view has been customized for Integra users. Remember, you can add additional columns to the table as required.\n  \n    Locate and click the relevant PO number to open the PO form.\n  \n  \n  Note: Ensure the view, Purchase Order is active. If not, click the drop-down arrow to select it and pin it as your default view.

Alternatively, these fields are visible in the Line details section of the PO. \n            Note: The Currency column is actually labelled, “Currency/Donor currency”, but it represents the PO currency. \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Tip: Another way to view the PO currency, click the Related  information bar to the right of the table and then click, Purchase order totals to expand that section. Click Refresh at the bottom of section and the PO currency will display in the Currency field.\n  \n    Scroll down to the Line details section of PO form.\n  \n  \n  \n    Review/update following information in the Line details section.\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Field\n          \n          \n            Required Entry\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Address\n          \n          \n            Select the Address tab and validate or update the delivery address and attention information.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Storage dimensions\n          \n          \n            Select the Product tab and review the Site, Warehouse, Location entries.\n            Note: For capitalized fixed assets, storage dimensions are not required.\n            IMPORTANT for CRRD: The Warehouse and Location fields are important to consider because when the warehouse staff receive the order at the warehouse or at the Port of Entry. For example, non-stock items and services require only a product receipt before posting. However, stock items (FIFO/FEFO), require the creation of a Receipt List, a Quality Order and a Product Receipt (Registration) before posting.\n            RAI: For stock items (FIFO/FEFO), the creation of a Receipts List and Quality Order is not required; only a Product Receipt is entered.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Click the Header tab and scroll down to the Setup section of header.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the Requester field, enter or select the name of the person whose supervisor/manager should approve the PO.\n    Under the Delivery section of header, Update/validate the Delivery date. This is the date that displays on the PO output.\n    If prepayment is required, review hte information immediately below this step. if not, proceed to step 10 below.\n  \n  \n    Click Purchase, then click Prepayment\n  \n  \n  \n    Enter the required fields in the Create or edit a prepayment window.\n  \n  \n  \n    Click Save, then continue to step 9. \n      \n      When the vendor submits the Prepayment Invoice and PO number, AP/Finance processes the prepayment. After confirmation of receipt is completed the vendor must submit the final invoice using the full amount and Integra triggers a process to reduce the prepayment against the final invoice.\n    \n  \n   \n  \n    On the toolbar at the top of page, click Workflow and click Submit.\n    Enter any relevant approval comments and click Submit.\n  \n  Result\n  Purchase order has been reviewed and submitted for approval.\n  Confirm and Transmit Purchase Order\n  Purpose\n  Use this procedure to confirm a PO that has been fully approved.\n  Note: The confirmation step is required before the PO can be transmitted to vendor.\n  Prerequisites\n  \n    PO has status Approved\n  \n  Steps\n  \n    From the Integra home page, navigate modules to Procurement and sourcing > Purchase orders > All purchase orders.\n  \n  \n  \n    Locate the relevant PO and click the PO number to open the PO form.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the menu at the top of page, click Purchase.\n  \n  \n  \n    Under the Update action pane, click Order confirmation details.

These numbers are set up as master data and are system-generated numbers. When first using Integra, these numbers will not be familiar to users, so further search capability is available to enable searching on information that is known, such as, name of a product or name of a vendor.\n  Searching Tips and Tricks\n  Use Keywords\n  Enter keywords in your search criteria, versus, full descriptions. This will ensure you retrieve the maximum number of results for your search. The sequence of information you enter must match the sequence the data item is named in the system.\n  Example: If you enter “Quick and Clean”, as your filter criteria for a vendor, but the vendor name in the system is labeled, “Quick & Clean”, the system will not find the vendor. However, if you entered just “Quick”, the system would retrieve all vendors that have “Quick” in the name.\n  Use Filter Operator “contains”\n  Integra provides multiple operator options to narrow down search results. As a rule, use contains as it provides the most flexible searching method.\n  Example: If you use operator begins with and you enter “mouse” as your search criteria, the system only retrieves items whose description begins with “mouse”; it would not retrieve the following item:\n  Lenovo Laser Wireless Mouse\n  However, if you use filter operator contains the system retrieves all items that have “mouse” somewhere in the description.\n  Search for a Product in a Field\n  The example below highlights the search functionality for the Item number field when creating a line in a purchase requisition. However, the steps also apply when searching for an item within other transactions in Integra.\n  Steps\n  \n    Open the purchase requisition.\n    In the Purchase requisition lines table, navigate to the relevant column to perform the search, e.g., Item number\n  \n  \n  \n    In the Item number column field, click the drop-down arrow.\n  \n  \n  \n    A search pop-up window appears which presents multiple columns, many of which provide further filtering functionality.\n  \n  Note: A column has further filter options when a drop-down arrow appears when mouse is hovered on the column title.\n  \n    On the Search name column header, click the drop-down arrow.\n  \n  \n  \n    Under the Search name section, select search operator contains from the drop-down selection list.\n    In the blank field below the filter operator field, enter part of the description and click Apply, e.g., Enter kit to return all items that have “kit” in the description.\n  \n  \n  \n    Review the list of retrieved results. E.g., In the above example, all items with “kit” in the name are displayed in the search results.\n  \n  Note: To expand the width of any column, to see more information, hover the mouse on the right border of the column heading until you see a double-sided arrow. Click, hold and drag this arrow to until desired column width is achieved.\n  \n    Locate the correct option in the results list and click anywhere in the line to auto-populate the Integra number into the field.\n  \n  \n  \n    Validate that the Item number field is populated.\n  \n  Note: Other information defaults based on the item number selected. This information is retrieved from the item master record.\n  E.g., Procurement category, Product name and Unit of measure.\n  Result\n  A search for a product has been performed.\n  Search for a Vendor in a Field\n  The example below highlights the search functionality for the Vendor field when creating a PR line.\n  Note: This search is a bit trickier than searching for items as it requires multiple drill-downs. Pay close attention to the steps outlined below.\n  Steps\n  \n    Navigate to the Vendor account field.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the Vendor account field, click the drop-down arrow.\n  \n  \n  \n    Click the All vendors tab.\n  \n  \n  \n    On the Vendor account column header, click the drop-down arrow.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the Vendor account field, click the drop-down arrow.\n  \n  \n  \n    In the Name column header, click the drop-down arrow.\n  \n  \n  \n    Under Name, select search operator Contains from the drop-down selection list.\n    In the blank text field, enter the vendor name, or part of the vendor name.\n    Click Apply.\n  \n  \n  \n    Locate and click the applicable vendor number from the list of results.\n  \n  \n  \n    The vendor number populates the vendor account field.

It will grow and continue to be updated as modifications are made to certain Integra processes.\n    If you have a question that is not listed in this FAQ, please submit a Integra Help Form.\n    \n      ‎General User Questions\n    How do I log into Integra?\n    Integra is a cloud-based application, which means it can be accessed from any location with an Internet connection. All new Integra users are provided (via their IRC email) with a link to the Integra Login page.\n    To log into Integra, you will need your IRC email and password and follow these step-by-step instructions. If you experience difficulty, please contact the SuperUser(s) in your department, your initial, frontline support.\n    \n      HQ SuperUsers (right-most column)\n      RAI SuperUsers (right-most column)\n    \n    How do I troubleshoot issues in Integra?\n    If you have questions about completing a process in Integra, please contact the Integra SuperUser in your department. To view current lists of SuperUsers, click the links below:\n    \n      HQ SuperUsers (right-most column)\n      RAI SuperUsers (right-most column)\n    \n    SuperUsers are department colleagues who have been identified to provide a first-level response for staff on basic questions, processes, and system functionality. If you have a question about the system itself:\n    \n      For HQ users, please visit the Integra Training and Support Page on RescueNet. \n      RAI Users should consult their SuperUsers.\n    \n    How do I scan and upload a document to Integra?\n    There are two options to scan and upload a document to the system.\n    Option 1: Using your mobile device, take a photo of the document (e.g., receipt) and email it to yourself. Next, save the attachment locally to your computer. Then, locate the transaction (e.g., expense report) in Integra, and select either the paperclip icon on the form, or the “Upload Receipt” button.\n    Option 2: Using a printer in your office, scan and email a copy of the document (e.g., receipt) to yourself. Next, save the attachment locally to your computer. Then, locate the transaction (e.g., expense report) in Integra, and select either the paper clip icon on the form, or the “Upload Receipt” button.\n    How do I change the email notification settings related to Integra?\n    \n      Click Settings (located in the top right of the Dashboard).\n      Select User Options.\n      Under Options, select Workflow.\n      Using the toggle, choose Yes or No to send notifications in email.\n    \n    How do I change the flow for approvals in Integra?\n    The approval process and authorization matrix are set up in Integra as systematic workflows. This ensures that the processes are followed consistently. When a process requires approval, the workflow determines which roles can approve. For example, if you are a budget holder, you will be assigned a system security role that allows you to approve requests for purchases.\n    To request a change of security, submit a request via the Change Integra Access Form. Your hiring manager will receive a request to approve the change of security roles.\n    To request a change to workflow, submit a request via the Change Integra Access Form. Your request will be reviewed by the Integra team. In some cases, the request will also be reviewed by the hiring manager or leadership level staff member.\n    What languages does Integra support? How do I change the language in the system?\n    The Integra Project Team understands that staff at the IRC speak and work in multiple languages. The chosen Microsoft ERP software solution has the capability to translate core elements (i.e., labels and headings) into 40 different languages. Decisions on additional translation capability (e.g., language of transaction descriptions, purchase orders, global pharmaceutical lists, etc.) will be made as the team’s work progresses.\n    The Settings menu includes several User Options, including language preference. To change the language in the system, please follow these steps in Integra, starting from the Integra Dashboard (Home page):\n    \n      Click Settings (located in the top right of the Dashboard).\n      Select User Options.\n      Under Options, select Preferences.\n      Under Language and Country/Region Preferences, select the drop-down arrow in the Language field.\n      Select the language of choice.\n      Click Save in the top left of the screen.\n    \n    RESULT: The language will change labels and headings only. The language will NOT change for the standard data that appears in drop-down fields or for “open text” fields.\n    How do I change the currency in Integra? [Non-RAI users only]\n    On any transaction form, select the drop-down in the currency field to process a transaction in a different currency. Please note: the base currency for the IRC is US Dollars.\n    Is it possible to personalize/customize my Integra layout?\n    Yes, it is possible to save personalized layouts to best fit the actions you perform in Integra. For detailed instructions, please see this reference guide.\n    How will I be notified of updates to Integra?\n    Updates to the system will be communicated via email and coordinated with upgrade schedules.\n    I don’t see all the functions I need to carry out my task in Integra. What do I do?\n    System security roles are assigned to Integra users based on the work they do as part of their job. If you feel you are missing access to the functions (specific modules, applications and tiles) in Integra, please submit a request via the Integra Help Form. The support staff will work with you and your manager to obtain the necessary approval for access.\n    Which standard IRC business applications interface with Integra?\n    Some existing IRC applications will interface with Integra. Please see this document for a listing of updates/changes being made to these applications so they align with Integra and the new business processes.\n    Will enhancement requests sent to Integra Support be implemented?\n    All enhancement requests are logged and prioritized by the Integra Team. Critical enhancements put into effect will be communicated via the Integra SuperUsers, or by email.\n    Assets (for CRRD Users)\n    A new asset received by the procurement team does not appear in Integra’s Fixed Assets module. What should I do?\n    If the asset was procured via purchase requisition, the D4 owner or local Supply Chain should confirm with Finance that the correct asset group has been assigned when reviewing the PR. If the asset was procured via Item Forecast, the D4 owner or local Supply Chain should confirm with Finance that the correct Project Category is linked to the Fixed Assets group. (NOTE: Capitalized fixed assets cannot be procured via the Item Forecast.) \n    What documents should be attached to a fixed asset record in Integra?\n    An equipment issue form, warrantee, technical sheet, or donation or disposal certificates are examples of the documents that may be needed, depending on the type of asset.\n    When should an Integra asset record be updated?\n    An asset record should be updated under the following circumstances: When a new asset is received; when the location of an asset is changed from one office to the other; when an asset is transferred from one office to another; when the custodian of an asset is changed; when the status of the asset changes (e.g., asset becomes damaged, lost, disposed, donated, etc.).\n    ATC Checks for Vendor Groups\n    How do I run an ATC check for a trade vendor?\n    If the anticipated annual spend is greater or equal to $2500, Global Supply Chain will raise an ATC for the vendor once the new vendor forms have been submitted. (For more information on vendor creation, see the Vendors: General Questions section of this FAQ.) An ATC check is not necessary for vendors if the anticipated annual spend is less than $2500.\n    How do I run an ATC check for an individual consultant?\n    As of February 3, 2020, an interim process for engaging individual consultants is in effect. For more information, please see the Engaging Individual Consultants page on RescueNet.\n    How do I run an ATC check for a sub-awardee?\n    Currently, ATC checks for sub-awardees cannot be run via the Integra-ATC interface. Please continue to raise ATC requests via the ATC portal. Once you’ve received ATC approval via email, forward this email to appsupport@rescue.org. The support team will notify you when the ATC details have been uploaded to Integra and the new sub-awardee vendor can become part of the appropriate workflow. For more detailed instructions, please see the Grants Master Data Management Integra User Guide.\n    Does Integra generate notifications for expired ATC checks?\n    Integra does not generate notifications for expired ATC checks. Global Supply Chain is responsible for monitoring expirations on ATC checks, and renewing those that have expired.\n    How do I pay a sub-awardee vendor that is currently on hold in Integra?\n    If you need to pay a sub-awardee that has a vendor record on hold in Integra, please contact appsupport@rescue.org. Please do not submit the record to workflow. In most cases, if a sub-awardee vendor record is not active in the 9IRC legal entity (for HQ), or 6DAT legal entity (for Atlanta), it means there are no active sub-awards for that legal entity with that vendor and/or that the vendor’s ATC details have not been loaded into Integra. If your office is paying one of these vendors, you will need to provide the most recent ATC clearance email to remove the hold from the vendor record.\n    Several vendors in Integra are currently on hold because of an expired Anti-Terrorism Check (ATC). How do I update vendors with expired ATCs?\n    Expired ATCs are updated by the Master Data Management (MDM) Team, who are responsible running yearly ATCs. If you see ATCs that haven’t been updated in Integra, please ask one of your office vendor creators to contact the MDM team via ServiceNow, so they can be corrected.\n     \n    BvA and Other Financial Reports\n    How do I access BvA and other financial reports?\n    BvA reports, as well as other Integra reports, can be accessed via Power BI, a Microsoft business analytics and reporting tool that serves as an add-on to Integra. It supplements Integra’s reports by providing users with the ability to retrieve data from a variety of sources (Integra and ISUN), and organize and structure the data into hierarchies. It creates visual reports that will help us identify and share insights, and drive better decision-making. For more information on Power BI, please see the Power BI FAQ.\n    How do I log in to Power BI?\n    To log in to Power BI, go to the Power BI website. In the upper-right corner, click Sign in, and log in with your IRC username (email) and password.\n    How do I access Integra reports in Power BI?\n    For step-by-step instructions on accessing reports in Power BI, please see the How to Access Your Power BI Reports quick reference guide. This guide also contains instructions on filtering reports and bookmarking pages in Power BI.\n    How do I gain permission to access Power BI?\n    Staff who frequently work with expense reports and BvA data – e.g., grant coordinators, program managers and unrestricted budget owners – currently use Power BI to view Integra reports. Users are assigned roles in Power BI based on the data for which they need access (i.e., relevant D4 code data). If you believe you need access to Power BI, please fill out an Integra Reporting with Power BI Access Form.\n    How do I reconcile the General Ledger with a specific sub-ledger?\n    Finance is responsible for ensuring that all general ledger accounts match the balances of the assigned sub-ledger accounts. If all information is posted from the sub-ledgers to the general ledger, balances will match. Discrepancies between a sub-ledger and the general ledger may arise if:\n    \n      Entries posted in the sub-ledger are adjusted/corrected at the general ledger level\n      Entries posted to the sub-ledger control account in the general ledger.\n    \n    It is recommended that Finance regularly review all general ledger accounts to ensure the control account does not allow direct posting to the general ledger. This will help prevent any discrepancies between sub-ledger and general ledger.\n    Contributions-in-Kind\n    Can I receive and distribute CIK inventory items through Integra?\n    Integra’s inventory management module should be used to receive and distribute CIK items tracked in inventory. Items not tracked in inventory should be distributed using the expense journal in Integra. For more details, please see this user guide. When distributing CIK items in Integra, please be sure to input the correct codes.\n    Contractors and Consultants\n    What is the process for engaging individual consultants?\n    As of February 3, 2020, a new process for engaging individual consultants is in effect.\n    If you are a Requester who plans to engage an individual consultant while the interim process is in effect, the process’s key requirements are as follows:\n    A purchase requisition (PR) and purchase order (PO) is not required when engaging individual consultants. Note, a PR and PO continues to be required for service contracts (i.e., engaging consulting companies/firms).\n    The Individual Consultant must complete a Vendor Information Form at the time the formal offer is extended, and the Requester must submit the completed form to the GSC Data Management Team (via the Integra Help Form).\n    The Individual Consultant must email invoices for processing (per the agreed payment terms) to AP (IRC.AccountsPayable@rescue.org) and cc the Hiring Manager.\n    For more information, please see the Engaging Individual Consultants page on RescueNet.\n    How do I pay service contracts in Integra? How do I close out service contracts that end without the full intended hours completed (e.g., there are ten hours in a purchase order, but it takes eight hours to complete the work)?\n    For service contracts, the user in charge of the Purchase Order (PO) needs to process PO receipts for time or deliverables rather than the full PO. If work ends with fewer hours than expected, follow the steps below to close out the contract:\n    \n      Go to the line item in PO for Service.\n      Select Update line.\n      Select Deliver remainder. The amount remaining to be received should appear.\n      Select Cancel quantity.\n    \n    Delegation of Workflow and Work Items\n    Integra enables users to delegate work in the following three ways:\n    \n      Delegate workflows to an authorized employee\n      Delegate approval of a specific PO\n      Create and submit an expense report on behalf of another employee\n    \n    How do I delegate approval of a PO to an authorized colleague on my behalf? \n    First, refer to the current list of IRC employee titles that have signing authority by threshold. This list can be found in the IRC Signatory Authority and Delegation Policy. Then, follow the steps in the Procure to Pay for Approvers user guide to delegate approval to the appropriate colleague.\n    How do I delegate approval of invoice/payment requests, travel advance requests, travel expense reports (TER) to an authorized colleague on my behalf?\n    First, refer to the Signature Authority page on RescueNet, managed by Accounts Payable. This page includes a current list of IRC staff who have signing authority for payments, and steps on how to submit a Payment Authority Request Form to request approval and threshold. Then, follow the steps in the How to delegate workflow in Integra quick reference guide to delegate to the appropriate colleague.\n    How do I submit an expense report on a colleague’s behalf? [HQ Users Only]\n    Please see the Expense Management section of this FAQ for how to create an expense report in Integra on a colleague’s behalf.\n    Expense Management\n    How do I ensure that my expense report is processed for payment?\n    For Travel and Expense Reports (TER) to be processed quickly and efficiently, they must be prepared correctly and properly reviewed by your supervisor. Please be sure to include the D7 (employee ID) for the staff member who incurred the expense on all expense reports and IRC Corporate Card/P-card transactions. Incomplete, late, and incorrect TER submissions to Accounts Payable (AP) have contributed to delays in processing payments. To help prevent future TER rejections, AP has prepared a list of Top Tips for Submitting Your TER. For help tracking the status of your expense report, please see the Tracking Purchase Requests, Expense Reports, and Other Items section of this FAQ.\n    How should documents be submitted for reimbursement be formatted?\n    When providing documents for reimbursement, please upload all necessary documents in a single PDF. This will significantly reduce processing time. Please do not provide multiple attachments (i.e., separate files for vouchers, invoices and receipts).\n    How can I confirm that my expense report has been paid?\n    Beginning September 2019, HQ and RAI staff who have submitted Travel and Expense Reports (TER) for reimbursement have begun receiving payment notifications when Accounts Payable (AP) makes payment on these reports. Every Thursday, AP will send payment confirmations for all TER submitted and processed by 12 PM Wednesday. Staff will need to wait approximately 2 business days before funds are credited to their personal bank accounts.\n    Is it possible to split an individual charge to different HQ-codes in Integra?\n    For P-cards only, select the Split button in the main Expense Report screen to charge to different projects. (Please note that Integra does not allow you to split multiple P-card charges simultaneously.) To split a non-P-card transaction, create separate lines or each project in your expense report. Do not use the Distribute Amounts button to charge to different codes.\n    How do I submit an expense report on a colleague’s behalf?\n    For instructions on submitting an expense report on a colleague’s behalf, please see Initiate an Expense Report for Another Employee in the Expense Management User Guide. You can view all assigned expense reports in a list page by navigating to Expense management > My expenses > Expenses delegated to me.\n    My expense report was rejected because the receipt was illegible. Is there a way around this?\n    If your receipt is difficult to read, please provide a credit card or bank statement as further evidence of the transaction. It is recommended that you also provide a comment in Integra explaining why you are including the credit card or bank statement\n    Are there default dimensions that can reduce the number of entries needed when processing expense reports? [RAI users only]\n    There are several ways to default dimensions in Integra to make processing transactions easier. Most are at the discretion of the local finance manager.\n    Default dimensions are determined by the project. For example, since there is only one Program Area (D3) used in conjunction with the dimension GB751, this dimension can be defaulted on the project; this means that each time a transaction for GB751 is processed, the D3 is populated automatically.\n    If your Operating Unit (D4) has only 1 location (e.g., Boise), the D4 can also be defaulted on all projects.\n    Are RAI caseworkers who travel frequently required to use Integra’s mileage reimbursement feature?\n    RAI caseworkers who travel frequently can continue to log their mileage and obtain reimbursement outside Integra.\n    Can Interns obtain reimbursement using Integra?\n    Interns do not have Integra access. Supervisors calculate interns’ reimbursements manually, then submit reimbursements on behalf of their interns in Integra.\n    How do I process IRC Corporate Card transactions in Integra?\n    For more information on the IRC Corporate Card, please see the IRC Corporate Card page on RescueNet or email Tr easury Services (irccorporatecard@rescue.org).\n    Where can I view transactions that have been posted (including account codes and financial dimensions)?\n    Navigate to General Ledger > Journal Entries > Inquiries and Reports >. Depending on the transaction, select Trial Balance, Accounting Source Explorer or Voucher Transactions.\n    Where can I find more information about processing expense reports?\n    For more information about processing expense reports, please visit the Accounts Payable page on RescueNet. \n    ETO Integration for RAI Users\n    What are the advantages to the ETO/Integra integration?\n    Beginning September 2020, the ETO/Integra integration will allow for improved visibility into third-party payments, payment processing, and inventory distribution for our RAI staff and clients. The relevant training materials have been updated.\n    How do I process client payments via the ETO/Integra integration?\n    When processing client payments, it is important that program areas selected in Integra correspond with the ETO program tag on the Project Code (D1). This will ensure transactions transfer correctly from Integra to ETO.\n    Also, the correct combination of D1, D3 and D9 must be used in Integra to ensure touchpoints are created in ETO. The ETO program tag on the D1 must match the client’s programmatic enrollment indicated by the Client ID (D9), and include a Program Area (D3) associated with the ETO program tag.\n    Note: As of October 1, 2021, the Client ID is its own field on each transaction. It is no longer a Financial Dimension. Client ID codes and values are not changing, and processes will remain the same, except where you enter and see the Client ID in each transaction. This enhancement will make searching easier, help reduce errors, and improve reporting.\n    Finance: Coding, Funding and Transactions\n    Where can I find guidance on inputting the correct financial codes into Integra?\n    With the go-live of Integra, the organization is transitioning from T-codes (used in SUN) to D-codes (used in Integra). Integra users should refer to the Financial Accounting Structure page on RescueNet for coding guidance.\n    How does the transition from SUN systems to Integra affect the codes we use?\n    Until that transition from SUN to Integra has been completed, the IRC will be using both financial systems at the same time. Each system has its own transaction coding structure – SUN Transaction codes (T-codes) and Integra Dimension codes (D-codes).\n    Beginning October 1, 2020, to minimize confusion and administrative burden, certain T-codes are being changed to their D-code equivalents.\n    The T-codes affected are the SUN T3/T5/T6 code values. While the code values will change, the purpose and usage of the codes will not change. SUN and all other systems that use T-codes (e.g., SUN, BvA, SCAN, TETRA, etc.), will be updated to accept the new code values and all historical data will be updated in these systems to reflect the new code values.\n    For more information, please see the Financial Accounting Structure page on RescueNet.\n    I work in HQ Finance. How do I process transactions related to field offices that are using Integra?\n    Each field office will have its own legal entity (D5) set up in when the office goes begins using the system. When Integra goes live in a field office, HQ Finance will receive a communication informing them of the office’s legal entity. To process transactions related a specific office, select the relevant D5 under the Legal Entity drop-down when in 9IRC in Integra.\n    Is the T4 (expenditure location) code available in Integra?\n    In Integra’s General ledger module, the T4 code (expenditure location) is located in each transaction line, under the Description field on the Voucher transactions list page. To access the Voucher transactions list page in Integra, go to Navigation pane > Modules > General ledger > Inquires and reports > Voucher transactions\n    How do I enter the Client ID in Integra?\n    Beginning October 1, 2021, the Client ID will be its own field on each transaction. This means the Client ID will no longer be recognized as the D9 Financial Dimension code. Instead, it will be entered as a separate, Client ID data-only field on each transaction. A separate field for the Client ID makes finding and selecting this critical information faster and easier.\n    How do I enter the Fixed Asset ID in Integra?\n    Beginning October 1, 2021, the Fixed Asset ID is its own field on relevant forms and templates. It is no longer recognized as the D10 Financial Dimension code. Instead of entering the Fixed Asset code as a D10 code, it is entered in a new and separate Fixed Asset ID-only field.\n    Is the month closed by the Legal Entity, or by HQ?\n    Month end is closed centrally at HQ, with a cutoff date of the 13th of each month for all legal entities.\n    How are funding limits currently determined in Integra?\n    Funding limits are determined by the total budget for a given project.\n    Inventory (for CRRD users)\n    Once Integra is live, how will warehouse staff be notified of a dispatch request?\n    When a dispatch is requested, program staff will share a signed picking list with warehouse staff (either e-signed via email or signed hard copy).\n    Is a waybill required when dispatching items from a warehouse?\n    Until further notice, a waybill is required if dispatching an item via individual staff member. If the item(s) are being collected directly by program staff, a waybill is not required – a signed packing slip is sufficient.\n    How long can local Supply Chain keep items returned from distribution to a warehouse before returning these items to on-hand inventory?\n    72 working hours is the maximum transit period for items returned from distribution to remain in on-hand inventory.\n    Where can we view items being transferred from one IRC warehouse to another in Integra?\n    These items are listed in the Transit Warehouse, which can be accessed from the On-hand inventory report.\n    When an item is transferred from one location to another within an IRC warehouse, how do I change the inventory location in Integra?\n    In an Integra transfer journal, change the inventory location to the new location within the warehouse.\n    What is the effect of having an open (not posted) counting journal in an IRC warehouse?\n    Having an open counting journal in Integra will prevent users from performing any receiving transactions on warehouses/locations being counted. (NOTE: During annual inventory, all locations are being counted. If an open journal is posted during annual inventory, receiving transactions will be blocked on all locations.)\n    What documents should be attached to a counting journal before it is posted?\n    A scanned copy of the signed counting list in which the quantities counted are recorded should be attached to a counting journal before posting.\n    Invoices\n    How do I process vendor invoices at HQ?\n    All vendor invoices must be submitted electronically to IRC.AccountsPayable@rescue.org by the vendor. The name of the vendor should appear in the email subject line. All submitted invoices should include the Purchase Order number. If vendors need to submit invoices on paper, they should send invoices to the following address:\n    ATTN: Accounts Payable\n    122 East 42nd Street\n    New York, NY 10168\n    Vendors should direct all questions to IRC.AccountsPayable@rescue.org.\n    Note: For transactions requiring a PR/PO, any invoices submitted without a PR/PO will be rejected by Accounts Payable (AP). The staff member will be notified to rectify before payment is made.\n    How do I process vendor invoices in CRRD and RAI offices that are using Integra?\n    Each CRRD and RAI office that uses Integra will have a dedicated email account set up for invoice processing. All vendors who provide goods and services to these offices will be instructed to submit invoices to the appropriate email address. The name of the vendor should appear in the subject line. All submitted invoices should include the Purchase Order number.\n    What if there is a discrepancy between an invoice amount and a PO amount?\n    The limits defining the degree of discrepancy that Accounts Payable (AP) will accept between a PO and an invoice are called tolerances. If an invoice amount is lower than the PO amount, or is higher than the PO amount by up to 5%, the invoice will be paid. If an invoice amount is higher than the PO amount by more than 5%, the requestor may need to contact the vendor for a revised invoice.\n    What should I do if Finance rejects an invoice due to unclear formatting?\n    Please contact the vendor to ensure the invoice formatting is simplified for easy processing by Finance. If you require guidance on simplifying the invoice, please contact your Supply Chain department.\n    Should invoice journals for HQ payments be prepared in 9IRC after Integra’s go-live date?\n    Yes. HQ payments are always part of the 9IRC legal entity.\n    How do I process outstanding invoices from before Integra’s go-live date?\n    All outstanding invoices from before Integra’s go-live date will should be submitted and processed in Integra.\n    Item Forecast for CRRD Users\n    I have downloaded the Item Forecast template from Integra to Excel, and I’m being prompted to log in. What should I do?\n    Select Log in with organizational account, and log in with your IRC username and password.\n    I can’t find my Legal Entity in the summary sheet drop-down menu in Excel. What should I do?\n    Contact your functional SuperUser, your initial, frontline support. Your SuperUser will escalate the issue to the Integra Team if needed.\n    My “Get Data” function is taking longer than 15-20 minutes. What should I do?\n    Check with your local IT department to ensure your Internet connection is working properly. If there is no problem with the Internet, please contact your department SuperUser.\n    I am populating procurement items in the Item Forecast sheet. I am having trouble finding certain required items. What should I do?\n    \n      If you cannot find the Product ID, contact your local Supply Chain department. You will be guided to the correct Product ID, or a new Product ID will be created by the MDM team.\n      If you cannot find the Project ID, Project Category, D3, D4, or D6, contact your local Finance department for assistance.\n    \n    I am inputting my procurement needs in the Integra Item Forecast module, and I need two different delivery dates for the same product. What should I do?\n    Create each delivery date on a separate line in Integra.\n    I’m not sure of my procurement needs on one of the budget lines. What should I do?\n    Enter a budget line into Item Forecast template. Enter the description, and enter the Placeholder Product ID in the Product ID field.\n    I’ve uploaded the Item Forecast template to Integra, and the Item Forecast lines do not appear in the Item Forecast module. What should I do?\n    Clear any filters that are applied to the Item Forecast headers in Integra. If this doesn’t work, contact your functional SuperUser.\n    Can I modify/update my procurement needs in Integra?\n    If the procurement need is still in Draft status in the Item Forecast module, it is possible to modify the Item Forecast lines and submit for approval. If the procurement is in Approved status, contact your local Supply Chain department to modify the procurement need in the Item Requirements module.\n    Is it possible to delete or cancel an Item Forecast line that has been approved?\n    Approved Item Forecast lines cannot be deleted. Once an Item Forecast line has been approved, Integra automatically creates an item requirement line. To delete/cancel an item requirement line, contact your local Supply Chain department.\n    If procurement requires quotations collection, or competitive bidding (e.g., RFQ, RFP), can this process be managed in Integra?\n    RFQ and RFP processes will remain offline (outside Integra) until further notice.\n    OTIS Interface\n    How does Integra project data relate to data in OTIS?\n    Integra interfaces with OTIS, the IRC’s online system for tracking funding opportunities and sub-grants. Key fields (i.e., start/end dates, budget amount, project name, contract number, etc.) from the OTIS T1 and T7 Overview pages “flow” to that grant’s Project page in Integra. Therefore, the accuracy of project data in Integra is dependent on the accuracy of OTIS data. This applies to both prime awards (T1) and sub-grants (T7).\n    P-Cards\n    How do I import and reconcile P-card charges?\n    To import and reconcile P-card charges, select Add unattached expenses from the banner menu. Select the charges you wish to import into Integra. Complete the process as you would for non-P-card charges. (If you do not see your P-card charges when you select Add unattached expenses, please submit a ticket via the Integra Training & Support Page on RescueNet.) For more information on P-card charges, see Attach Credit Card Transactions in the Expense Management for Frequent Users user guide. (Note: P-card transactions submitted on vouchers should be processed in Integra.)\n    Is it possible to split an individual charge to different HQ-codes in Integra?\n    Select the Split button in the main Expense Report screen to charge to different projects. (Please note that Integra does not allow you to split multiple P-card charges simultaneously.)\n    Receipts\n    Do all receipts need to be uploaded into Integra?\n    Only receipts for amounts more than $25 (USD) need to be uploaded into Integra. (This includes receipts for purchases made with P-cards.)\n    Is it possible to post receipts in a foreign currency? [Non- RAI staff only]\n    If you are posting receipts in a foreign currency, you must use Oanda to convert the amount into US dollars. Ensure the date on the receipt and the historical date in Oanda conversion are the same. Take a screen shot of the conversion in Oanda, and then upload both the receipt and the screen shot into Integra. (Note: The currency default of US dollars on the expense report line in Integra should not be changed. If this currency default is changed, you will receive an error when trying to submit your expense report.\n    Shared Program Costs\n    Should budgets for Shared Program Costs (SPCs) be uploaded to Integra?\n    Yes. The rollout of Integra does not impact policy regarding SPCs. In Integra, SPC budgets are uploaded in one line using standard Project Categories. (NOTE: The tool used to allocate expenses in Integra has been customized for the system, and differs from the tool allocation tool previously used in SUN. This tool will be shared with country offices before they begin using Integra.\n    Sub-Projects and Sub-Awardee Vendors\n    How do I create a new sub-awardee vendor?\n    New sub-awardee vendor records should only be created under the following circumstances:\n    \n      You cannot find a partner record in OTIS to which to assign your sub-award opportunity, and/or:\n      You cannot find the appropriate vendor record to be paid in Integra.\n    \n    Please refer to the Grants Master Data Management Integra User Guide for instructions on creating a new sub-awardee vendor record in Integra.\n    How do I run an ATC for a sub-awardee?\n    Currently, ATC checks for sub-awardees cannot be run via the Integra-ATC interface. Please continue to raise ATC requests via the ATC portal. Once you’ve received ATC approval via email, forward this email to appsupport@rescue.org. The support team will notify you when the ATC details have been uploaded to Integra and the new sub-awardee vendor can become part of the appropriate workflow. For more detailed instructions, please see the Grants Master Data Management Integra User Guide.\n    How do I pay a sub-awardee vendor that is currently on hold in Integra?\n    If you need to pay a sub-awardee that has a vendor record on hold in Integra, please contact appsupport@rescue.org. Please do not submit the record to workflow. In most cases, if a sub-awardee vendor record is not active in the 9IRC legal entity, it means there are no active HQ-managed sub-awards with that vendor and/or that the vendor’s ATC details have not been loaded into Integra. If HQ is paying one of these vendors on behalf of the field, you will need to provide the most recent ATC clearance email to remove the hold from the vendor record.\n    Is it necessary to request a T7/D1 extension in OTIS in order to see a sub-project for my sub-award in Integra?\n    Yes. Sub-award sub-projects are created automatically in Integra through the OTIS-Integra integration after the OTIS T7 request workflow is completed. Note: T7s for sub-awards will be replaced by D1 extensions in Integra.  D1 extensions should be requested in OTIS for all new sub-awards managed by offices using Integra (currently HQ only), regardless of the sub-award amount. This includes sub-awards amounting to less than 25,000 USD. The documents required for sub-awards amounting to less than 25,000 USD are the same as those for sub-awards amounting to 25,000 USD or more.\n  \n  \n    Tracking Purchase Requests, Expense Reports, and Other Items\n    How do I track the status of a Purchase Requisition (PR) in Integra?\n    The status of a PR can be viewed by clicking “All purchase requisitions” within the Procurement and sourcing module in Integra. The various statuses that can be assigned to a PR in Integra are listed and defined below:\n    \n      Draft: A PR in Draft status is being worked on by the user/requestor, and still needs to be submitted.\n      In review: The D4 owner is reviewing the PR.\n      Closed: The D4 owner has approved the PR. A draft Purchase Order (PO) has been created and can be accessed.\n      Approved: If a PR is listed as “approved,” it means the vendor has not been added to the PR, and the PR has not been fully processed. If you see “approved” next to a PR on which you’re working, action is required by the D4 owner to add the vendor.\n    \n    How do I track the status of a Purchase Order (PO) in Integra?\n    The status of a PO can be seen by clicking All purchase orders in the Procurement and Sourcing module. Each PO is assigned both an Approval status and a Purchase order status. The various approval statuses that can be assigned to a PO are listed and defined below:\n    \n      Draft: A PO in Draft approval status needs to be edited by the user/requestor or submitted to workflow. If PO in draft approval status has a purchase order status of Received, it a means the user has changed the PO, and the PO must be submitted. If the Purchase order status is Cancelled, it means the user has cancelled the PO.\n      In review: The PO is being reviewed by the individual with signing authority.\n      Approved: The PO has been approved by individual(s) with higher signatory authority, and is ready to be confirmed by the user.\n      Confirmed: The PO has been confirmed by the user and is ready to be sent to the vendor. If a PO in Confirmed approval status has a purchase order status of Open order, it means the PO has been sent to the vendor. If the purchase order status is Received, it means the goods have been received by user. If the purchase order status is Invoiced, it means AP has posted the vendor invoice against the PO.\n    \n    Can I upload a document into Integra once a Purchase Order (PO) has been confirmed?\n    Currently, it is not possible to upload documents into Integra once a PO has been confirmed. If you wish to post an invoice in the system at this point in the process, follow the steps below:\n    \n      Open the PO and navigate to the Purchase Order tab.\n      On the Maintain menu under the Purchase Order tab, select Request Change. This will update the PO to Draft status, meaning you will be able to attach documents.\n      Click the paper clip icon on the top right side of the window. Select New > File > Browse, and select the document you wish to upload. The document will be uploaded automatically.\n      After attaching the document, you will need to Submit the PO to Workflow, where it will be automatically approved. (If you click the Integra Refresh button, the PO’s approval status will be updated to Confirmed. You may have to click the Integra Refresh button more than once.)\n      You can now confirm a product receipt. For instructions on this process, refer to the Procurement Purchase Requisition to Delivery and Receipt user guide.\n    \n    How do I track the status of an expense report in Integra? [Non-RAI users only]\n    To view expense reports you’ve submitted, click My expenses > Expense reports in the Expense Management module. The statuses of the expense reports you’ve submitted are listed and defined below:\n    \n      Draft: An expense report in draft status needs to be edited by the user/requestor.\n      In review: The expense report is being reviewed by your supervisor (or, if you are submitting an expense report on a colleague’s behalf, your colleague’s supervisor), or Accounts Payable (AP). To determine which party is reviewing your expense report, click the expense report workflow.\n      Processed for payment: The expense report has been approved and the payment is waiting to be released.\n    \n    Once the expense report has been paid, the Payment date and Payment voucher columns will be filled out.\n    If you are an approver and would like to check the status of expense reports you’ve been asked to approve, click My expenses > All expense reports in the Expense Management module to see all expense reports in the system. The statuses of the expense reports contained in All expense reports are listed and defined below:\n    \n      Approved: The expense report has been approved, but not processed for payment.\n      Rejected: The user must edit and re-submit the expense report, or the expense report has been cancelled.\n      Processed for payment: The expense report has been processed and the payment is awaiting release or has been released.\n    \n    How do I access comments on work items?\n    The comments on Expense Reports, Purchase Requests, and Purchase Orders will enable users to see why they may have been rejected/returned, and the steps required to have them approved. For instructions on accessing these comments see the Accessing Comments on Expense Reports, Purchase Requests, and Purchase Orders Quick Reference Guide.\n    Can I view transactions from different fiscal years in Integra?\n    No. Integra only allows users to view transactions from a single fiscal year at a time. The same is true for legal entities.\n    Vendors and Purchase Requisitions\n    What is the process for raising a PR in Integra at HQ?\n    The PR Creation process for HQ staff has the following two key components:\n    \n      Each HQ department will have one or more focal points (PR Creators) who will be responsible for creating PRs and confirming receipt of goods or services (except engaging individual consultants) for their department.\n      A centralized PO Creation Team, consisting of six members of the Nairobi-based GSC Master Data Management (MDM) Team has been established. This MDM team of PO Creators is responsible for creating and submitting the POs for approval and sending the POs to the vendors.\n    \n    For more information, please see this Quick Reference Guide: How do I know which Method of Procurement to use for the product(s) or service(s) I need?\n    If you have been designated a PR Creator in your department, please see the PR/PO FAQ for more information on the centralized procurement process.\n    Note: For transactions requiring a PR/PO, any invoices submitted without a PR/PO will be rejected by Accounts Payable (AP). The staff member will be notified to rectify before payment is made.\n    What is the process for raising a PR in Integra in non-HQ locations?\n    For guidance on procurement in non-HQ locations, please visit the RAI Training Page on RescueNet.\n    If a PO becomes invalid during the course of a transaction, will the requestor be notified?\n    Yes. Requestors who wish to remove invalid POs from Integra should submit an Integra Help Request Form.\n    What is the process for adding a vendor in Integra?\n    NYHQ: Regardless of spend, programs and departments are required to contact Supply Chain when they wish to add or change Integra data or records associated with a vendor (excluding beneficiaries and employees), service, good or purchase agreement (i.e., master data). The Master Data Management (MDM) team in Nairobi will manage the creation of the vendor record in Integra.\n    CRRD and RAI: If the annual anticipated spend is 2,500 USD or above, the office should contact Supply Chain and request that the vendor be created in Integra (see NYHQ process above). If the annual anticipated spend is less than 2,500 USD, authorized Supply Chain/Logistics staff in the office may create the vendor Integra, ensuring all necessary fields are populated and required supporting documentation is attached to the vendor record.\n    Please note that if year-to-date transactions with a vendor exceed 2,500 USD, the vendor will automatically be placed on hold in Integra, meaning no new transactions with the vendor can take place until the vendor passes an ATC check.\n    If my department has a relationship with a vendor, do I still have to contact Supply Chain to create a vendor record?\n    Yes. Adding or changing data or records associated with a vendor is Supply Chain’s responsibility. (In CRRD and RAI offices, authorized Supply Chain/Logistics staff may create the vendor in Integra if the anticipated spend is less than 2,500 USD.)\n    For petty cash payments, does a vendor need to be created in Integra?\n    No. If a payment counts as petty cash as per payment policy in the office, a vendor does not need to be created in Integra. (In cases where multiple petty cash payments are made for a specific vendor, offices are encouraged to create/define their own policy determining whether these vendors should be created in Integra.)\n
