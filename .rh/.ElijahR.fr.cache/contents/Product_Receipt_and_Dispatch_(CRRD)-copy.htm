  Purpose
  Use this procedure to create a transfer order to transfer inventory from one IRC warehouse to another IRC warehouse, within the same Integra project.
  This is a two-step process:
  
    Unreserve the quantity of the item being transferred from the sending warehouse to make it available for transfer
    Create a transfer order to ship inventory from the sending warehouse to the receiving warehouse
  
  Important Tip: Performing this procedure works best with two concurrent sessions of Integra open.
  Sending Warehouse Enters Product Receipt for Receiving Warehouse
  There are situations in which the sending warehouse performs the product receipt steps for the receiving warehouse in Integra. In these situations, follow the steps in the following procedure Receive Product on a Transfer Order prior to saving and closing the transfer order.
  Prerequisites
  
    There is enough on-hand quantity of item being transferred to perform the transfer
    It has been confirmed that the quantity of product to be transferred is available in the sending storage location
  
  Steps
  Unreserve the Quantity of Product to Transfer
  
    From the Integra Home page, navigate the modules to Project management and accounting > Projects > All Projects.
      
    
    On the All projects grid, in the Filter field, enter the project ID to which the item is associated.
    Click the checkbox to the left of the line to select the project.
    On the menu at the top, click Plan tab and under the Item requirements section, click Item requirements.
  
  
  
    In the list of item requirements, click the checkbox to the left of the item being transferred.
    On the menu at the top of the page, click Manage and then click Inventory > Reservation.
  
  
  
    Click the Reservation field  and reduce the value by the quantity being transferred. a
  
  For example, if the current reservation reflects a quantity of 50, and 5 items are being transferred to another warehouse, the value in the Reservation field should be updated to 45.
  
  
    Click Display dimensions to add inventory dimensions to the display.
  
  
  
    Click the checkbox next to each dimension to add.
    Click OK to proceed.

  Transfer Inventory from Project to Project
  Purpose
  Use this procedure to transfer inventory from one project to another, within the same reporting entity and same warehouse.
  
    For projects that are closed, the project must be reopened to enable the transfer.
    A partial quantity or full quantity of inventory can be transferred to another project.
    Once transferred, the transferred quantity must be reserved to the new project.
  
  
  Example scenario: There is excess inventory left on an end-of-grant project that will be transferred to another project.  
  
  IMPORTANT: Check on the On-Hand list continuously throughout this procedure to validate the movement of the inventory from one project to another.
  Prerequisites
  
    You have confirmed, via the On-hand List, that there is sufficient quantity of inventory on the sending project to transfer. 
      
        View the quantities under columns Physical inventory and Physical reserved and validate the Location in which the item is stored.
      
    
    The PO on which the items were originally purchased has been fully received and invoiced. This ensures that costs appear correctly on the transfer journal.
    Financial dimensions from originating PO are known.
  
  Full and Partial Quantity Transfer Scenarios
  1. Transfer Full Quantity of Inventory from Sending Project
  When transferring the full quantity of inventory from one project to another, the delivery remainder quantity on the sales order must be cancelled to make the quantity available for reservation on a different project. This is done by performing the following steps:
  
    On the Item requirements page, click Manage > Inquiries > Sales order. 
    Under the Sales order lines section, locate and select the relevant line item and click Update line > Deliver remainder. 
    On the Deliver remainder pane, click Cancel quantity.
  
  2. Transfer Partial Quantity of Inventory (when some inventory has already been distributed)
  A quantity of the inventory has already been distributed and there is a remaining quantity available to be transferred. In this case, complete the same steps above for cancelling quantity of delivery remainder in sales order.
  Tip: To determine whether any inventory for a specific product has already been distributed for a project click the Transactions tab for the item in the On hand list.
  3. Transfer Partial Quantity of Inventory (where no inventory has been distributed)
  In this case, the quantity to be transferred must be unreserved in the item requirements of the sending project (instead of cancelling the deliver remainder quantity on the sales order because the inventory is yet to be distributed.) This is done by performing the following steps:
  
    On the sending project, navigate to Item requirements > Manage > Inventory > Reservation.
    On the relevant reservation line, reduce the quantity under the Reservation column by the quantity to be transferred.
  
  Steps
  
     Per the three scenarios listed above, either cancel the delivery remainder quantity on the sales order or unreserve the inventory on the item requirement line.
    Navigate to Inventory management > Journal entries > Items > Transfer.

  Product Returns - Business Process Information
   
  Process Flow - Create Return PO for Vendor (to obtain credit)
  
  Once an invoice is posted against a PO, a return purchase order is created to return the received products to obtain a credit for the returned inventory.
  Return purchase orders are similar to purchase orders but use a different purchase order type and the quantity entered is a negative value.
  Process Flow - Beneficiary Returns to IRC Warehouse
  
  On occasion, items distributed to beneficiaries are returned to the IRC warehouse. Since a packing slip has been posted, the project has been expensed and the inventory is no longer available on-hand. To see the items in inventory in the warehouse, a return is processed. Beneficiary returns are processed with a negative item requirement.
  When a negative quantity is entered on an item requirement, the return lot ID field is used to select the related packing slip for the return. Once the packing slip is posted, products are received back into inventory and the expense is reversed. If revenue had already been recognized for this item requirement distribution, upon next invoice proposal, a credit will be generated and the revenue will be reversed. That inventory is released by creating another item requirement to process the release.
