  Purpose
  Use this procedure to navigate a project form in Integra and validate the information contained within the various sections of the form.
  Note: Only Finance has the authority to update fields in the project form.
  Prerequisites

    Sub-project exists in Integra (if applicable)
  
  Steps
  
    From the Integra home page, navigate to Project management and accounting > All projects.
  
  
  
    In the ALL PROJECTS grid, use the filter functionality to search for your specific project.
  
  Tip: To search for a specific project, click the Project ID column header to activate a filter window. You can then enter the full project ID (or portion of the ID) to limit search results.
  
    In the list of results, click the relevant project ID to open the project form.
  
  
  
    Click the Project menu item at the top of the screen to display an action pane that contains multiple action groups and tasks specific to that group. The following tasks are accessed via the menu selections below.

    Click the Project menu item again to collapse the action pane.
  
  
  
    Review/validate the following fields under the various sections of the project form.
  
  Note: There are many more sections and fields in the project form than what is presented in this guide; only fields of relevance are listed. Use the up and down arrows to the far right of a section header to expand or collapse the section. Clicking on the section header also achieves this action.

    Scroll to the right in the grid to view more information.
    To filter results for a specific project budget, click the Dimension values column header to activate the filter window. In the filter field, enter the D1/project ID enclosed between two asterisks (wild cards) and click Apply. E.g., *DF104*. (This is the same as selecting the filter operator “contains”)
  
  
    ‎
  
    Review the following columns for the budget account entries. Scroll to the right to view all columns.

  End of procedure
    ‎
  Use the Accounting Source Explorer to View Transaction Details
  Purpose
  Use the Accounting Source Explorer (ASE) to extract detailed transaction data from Integra and view details by each financial dimension.
  Only Finance, budget owners, and budget managers have access to ASE.
  Steps
  
    Log into Integra and ensure the correct legal entity is selected in the top right corner, e.g.,9IRC.
  
  
  Note: If extracts are required for multiple legal entities, extracts must be run separately for each legal entity.
  
    From the Integra home page, navigate to General ledger > Inquiries and reports > Accounting source explorer.
  
  
  
    In the Financial dimension set field, click the drop-down arrow to select the desired option for viewing transactional information.
    In most cases, the dimension set All should be selected. This set includes Main Account and financial dimensions D0 through D9.
    The other financial dimension combinations available in the drop-down selection list may be used as required.
    Once the financial dimension set is selected, the data grid automatically refreshes with applicable data. (This may take a few seconds to load.)
  
  
  Additional Transaction Notes:
  The data displayed is for the current period only. If a specific date range is required, click Update on the menu at the top and adjust the From date and To date fields. The date range must fall within the same fiscal year. If you are looking for multiple fiscal years, run an ASE extract separately for each year.
  If required, filter by a specific financial dimension (or dimensions) by clicking on the column header for the dimension and enter a specific financial dimension.
  E.g., If you want to only view transactions for project GB728, click the D01ProjectCode column header to bring up the filter search window; apply filter constraint Contains, enter the GB728 in the filter field, and click Apply.
    ‎
  Export the Data to Excel for further Manipulation
  
  
    Click export icon in the top right corner of the screen, select Accounting Source Explorer and click Download. This downloads the file to the Downloads folder on your computer.
    Open the exported Excel file and manipulate the data as required.
  
  End of procedure
    ‎
  Display Project Transactions (Voucher Details)
  Purpose
  Use this procedure to extract transaction details for a project(s).
  This transaction provides multiple filter options with which to view transaction details. For example, transactions may be extracted for a specific D1, D4, or main account (or a combination of all); a date range may be specified; or a journal number range may be specified.
  Steps
  
    Log into Integra and ensure the correct legal entity is selected in the top right corner, e.g., 9IRC.
  
  
  
    From the Integra home page, navigate the modules to General ledger > Inquiries and reports > Voucher transactions.
  
  
    
  
  
    Customize the table according to your filtering needs. Refer to the table below for guidance on the different types of filters that can be applied.
  
  Note: The option(s) selected under the Table column determine the field options available in the subsequent columns.
  The column Derived table automatically adopts the value selected in the preceding Table column; this value does not need to be changed and so is not included in the guidance table below. You can add/remove as many rows in the table as required to satisfy your filter requirements. Use the Add or Remove buttons to do this. You can save a query for future use by clicking the Modify button and selecting Save as from the drop-down menu.

  Example: To enter multiple D4s, enter OSEPR,OSEMG,OSEER,OSEAT
  
    To view all values that begin with a certain value, enter the value followed by an asterisk
  
  Example: To view details for all expense accounts, enter 7*. This retrieves all main accounts that begin with 7.
  Example: To view all DFID D1s, enter DF*.
  
    To view a range of values, separate the range with two periods.
  
  Example: To view all transactions between May 1 to May 31, enter 5/1/2020..5/31/2020.
  
    Once all criteria are entered, click OK in the bottom right-hand corner to extract results.
  
  
  
    Review the list of results. Scroll to the right to see all information.
  
  Note: To view any scanned/attached documents, e.g., signed invoices, refer to the steps outlined after this procedure, “View Source Documents”.
  
    If required, extract results to Excel for further analysis. To do this, click the export icon in the top right corner of the screen, select General journal entry and click Download. This downloads the file to the Downloads folder on your computer.
