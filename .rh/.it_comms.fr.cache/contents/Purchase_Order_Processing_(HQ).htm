    Business Process Flow
     
    
    Purchase Order Creation
    A purchase order defines the goods/services, quantities, prices, discounts, payment terms, date of performance or shipment, other associated terms and conditions, and identifies a specific vendor. Once the PR is reviewed and approved by the D4 owner, it becomes a draft purchase order.
    The PO can now be managed and submitted for approval; it follows a defined workflow approval process depending on the authority level (spend level).
    
      Before a purchase order is submitted to Workflow, it should be reviewed for the following:
        
          Confirm all the data looks accurate:
            
              Project ID (D1)
              Project Category (D2)
              Item Number
              Quantity
              Unit price
              Vendor account/name
              Inventory Dimensions
            
          
        
      
      Financial dimensions are entered
      Check the currency code on the PO line(s). If the currency is other than USD, contact the PR requester and confirm the requester entered the Unit price(s) on the PR in the Vendor’s desired currency.
    
    For services and events, look at the order quantities and unit prices. Do the order quantities and unit prices support partial receipt and invoicing of the service? Services are sometimes based on a time period (i.e. unit of measure for hour, weekly, month or year) and services are delivered by that time period (think of a grant writer charging by the hour). Sometimes services are delivered based on a body of work. For example, a translator may be hired to translate 10 documents, but agrees to provide them 2 at a time. For events, it is common to make multiple payments prior to the event. If the order is for an event with an order quantity of 1 and a unit price of $12,000, that would not support multiple receipts and multiple payments. But if the purchase order was changed to show an order quantity of 2 and a unit price of $6,000, this would support doing 2 receipts and 2 payments, while leaving the overall value of the order unchanged
    Once the PO is approved, it can then either physically be mailed or emailed to the vendor.
    Learning objectives:
    
      Submit Purchase Order for Approval
      Access Approved Purchase Order and Confirm in System
    
    Note: Automated Funding Limit Alerts. An alert displays when the funding limit has exceeded 90% of the budget. This alert displays any time the Unit price is updated or Save is clicked.
    An additional alert displays when the funding limit has exceeded 100% of the budget. Once the funding limit has reached 100%, a budget revision is required with the appropriate budget holder to proceed with a purchase order.
    Submit Purchase Order (PO) for Approval
    Purpose

    Prerequisites

    Before a PO is submitted to Workflow, it should be reviewed for the following:
    Confirm all the data looks accurate:
    
      Project ID (D1)
      Project Category (D2)
      Item Number
      Quantity
      Unit price
      Vendor account/name
      Inventory Dimensions
      Financial dimensions are entered
      Check the currency code on the PO line(s).

    Steps
    
      Go to Procurement and sourcing > Purchase orders > All purchase orders
    
    
    Note: Ensure the Purchase Order List Page view is active. If not, click the drop-down arrow to select it and pin it as your default view. This view has been customized for Integra users.
    
      Locate the relevant PO and click the PO number to open the PO form.
    
    
    
      Navigate to the Purchase order lines section of PO.
    
    Note: Ensure the Purchase Order view is active. If not, click the drop-down arrow to select it and pin it as your default view. This view has been customized for Integra users.
    
      Review the following information to confirm it is accurate and complete:
    
    
      
        
          
          
        
        
          
            
              Project ID
            
            
              Selecting the appropriate Project ID will also increase the accuracy of the project’s budget information in Integra, which will help the team managing the budget to more effectively do so.
                  ‎
                  ‎The Project ID field and the D01Project_Code field on the Financial dimensions tab both require entry of the same value. The completed fields update different modules in Integra, so it is not enough to enter only one field with the value.
            
          
          
            
              Item number
            
            
              An item number is product identifier number associated with a Product Name in Integra.
            
          
          
            
              Quantity
              Account
            
            
              Confirm the quantity is correct.
              Ensure all financial dimensions are correct in the Account field.
               
            
          
        
      
    
     
    
      Navigate to the Line details section of PO.
    
    
    
      
        
          
          
        
        
          
            
              Project category
            
            
              On the Project tab, ensure the correct project category is entered in the Project category field.
            
          
          
            
              Address
            
            
              Select the Address tab and enter the delivery address and attention information.
            
          
          
            
              Storage dimensions
            
            
              Select the Product tab and review the Site, Warehouse, Location
            
          
        
      
    
    Note: Vendor prepayments for PO related transactions
    
      For a purchase order where a prepayment to the vendor is required, click Purchase, then click Prepayment.
    
    
    
      Enter the required fields in the Create or edit a prepayment window.
    
    
    
      Click Save, then continue with the remaining steps to submit the PO for approval.
      When the vendor submits the Prepayment Invoice and PO number, AP/Finance processes the prepayment. After confirmation of receipt is completed the vendor must submit the final invoice using the full amount and Integra triggers a process to reduce the prepayment against the final invoice.
      On the toolbar at the top of page, click Workflow and click Submit.
      Enter any relevant approval comments and click Submit.
      It is critical to verify that all required information is complete prior to submitting through the approval workflow. Examples of required data include but is not limited to the following:
        
          Project ID
          Requestor
          Item number and quantity
          Vendor information
          Financial dimensions
          Inventory dimensions
          Project Category
          Attached documentation related to the PR
          Statement of Work (SOW), Simple Service Agreement or Quotation
          IT Purchase details
        
      
      In the Purchase order workflow – Submit window, add a comment in the Comment field then click Submit.
    
    Note: Include detailed information for the approvers.
