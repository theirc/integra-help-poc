  Purchase Requisition Creation – General Information
  A purchase requisition is an internal document that authorizes the procurement staff member to buy goods or services based upon approval of the requisition.
  Purchase requisitions have a defined purchase requisition approval workflow which controls the approval process of the purchase requisition from the time it is submitted to the workflow until it is approved by all users in the approval flow.
  Each HQ department will have one or more focal points (PR Creators) who will be responsible for creating PRs and confirming receipt of goods or services (except engaging individual consultants) for their department.
  A centralized PO Creation Team, consisting of six members of the Nairobi-based GSC Master Data Management (MDM) Team has been established. This MDM team of PO Creators is responsible for creating and submitting the POs for approval and sending the POs to the vendors.
  Since a PR is a request and an internal document, it establishes an intent to buy, not a commitment to buy and it is not subject to spend limits or thresholds.
  Things to Consider before Creating a Purchase Requisition
  Refer to the Methods of Procurement Table
  In some cases, a Procurement Card, Corporate Credit Card or Direct to Invoice may be the correct choice instead of PR_PO.
    ‎See How do I know which Method of Procurement to use for the product(s) or service(s) I need?
  A PR/PO must be confirmed in Integra before an invoice is submitted by a Vendor to the IRC:
  For transactions requiring a PR/PO, any invoices submitted without a PR/PO will be rejected by Accounts Payable (AP). The staff member will be notified to rectify before payment is made.
  How do I process vendor invoices at HQ?
  All vendor invoices must be submitted electronically to IRC.AccountsPayable@rescue.org by the vendor. The name of the vendor should appear in the email subject line. All submitted invoices should include the Purchase Order number. If vendors need to submit invoices on paper, they should send invoices to the following address:
  ATTN: Accounts Payable
  122 East 42nd Street
  New York, NY 10168
  Vendors should also direct all questions to IRC.AccountsPayable@rescue.org.
  Gather required information before PR creation
  Setting up a PR completely and accurately is essential to ensuring more efficient procurement processing, invoicing and data quality for reporting purposes. Before creating a PR in Integra, the PR Creator should consider the following questions to correctly determine the order quantities and unit prices for the goods or services being purchased:
  For products, does RESCUE have a Purchase Agreement?
  Purchase agreements have been loaded into Integra for some vendors that provide products used by a large segment of RESCUE staff. Some examples of those vendors are Planson (laptops, computer accessories, PC-based software) Taylor Made Graphics (business printing and graphics) and Capita Translation Services (translation services).
  When creating a new purchase requisition, please first select Contract as the Pricing type and see if there is a purchase agreement with a vendor that provides the goods/services you are seeking. If you cannot find a purchase agreement, then select Quote as the Pricing type.
  For services, are the services for an hourly/weekly/monthly/annual rate, or are the services based upon deliverables? How will those services be received - all at once, or in multiple receipts?
  How will the vendor invoice RESCUE for the goods and/or services?
  How do I structure the PR to efficiently facilitate confirmation of receipt and invoicing?
  If the requester knows the vendor to use for the procurement, in what currency will the vendor be paid?
  Integra’s default currency is USD and it presumes the unit prices are in USD. If the vendor needs to be paid in a currency other than USD, the requester must manually convert currency to USD outside of Integra.

            Name
          
          
            Include the name of the staff member initiating the request so the PO Creation Team will be able to update the Requestor field in the PO.
              ‎
              ‎The Attention field is also automatically copied into a PO line, and can provide additional context to the PO Creation Team
          
        
        
          
            Project ID
          
          
            Selecting the appropriate Project ID will also increase the accuracy of the project’s budget information in Integra, which will help the team managing the budget to more effectively do so.

  Create a PR (with purchase agreement)
  Purpose
  Use this procedure to create a PR that references a purchase agreement.
  Purchase agreements have been loaded into Integra for many of our vendors that provide products used by a large segment of RESCUE. Some examples of those vendors are Planson (laptops, computer accessories, PC-based software) Taylor Made Graphics (business printing and graphics) and Capita Translation Services (translation services).
  The key differences when creating a PR that references a purchase agreement versus one that doesn’t are the following:
  The Pricing type selected on the initial PR creation pane must be Contract (vs. Quote).
  The vendor and unit price for item/service defaults from the agreement.
  Note: All offices/departments must liaise with Global Supply Chain when adding or changing Integra data or records associated with a trade vendor to procure goods or services. This includes trade vendor records, products (items) and purchase agreements, regardless of spend, and to draft statements of work with an existing trade vendor.

            Enter the quantity required.
            Important: This field defaults with a value of “1” but must be overwritten with the correct quantity.
          
        
        
          
            Unit price
          
          
            This value defaults from the purchase agreement.
          
        
        
          
            Vendor account
          
          
            This value defaults from the purchase agreement.
          
        
        
          
            Vendor name
          
          
            This value defaults from the purchase agreement.
          
        
      
    
  
   
  
    Scroll down to the Line details section.
  
  
  
    Click the Project tab.
    In the Project category field, select the correct project category from the drop-down selection list.
  
  Note: If you do not see the correct project category in the drop-down selection list, contact Finance for guidance. Do not select an incorrect project category!
  
    Scroll back up to the Purchase requisition lines section and scroll to the right until you see the Account field.
  
  
  
    In the Account field, notice the values already populated in the account string, e.g., main account, D1, D2, and D5 codes. (The main account and D2 values were updated based on the project category entered in step 6 above.)
    Click the drop-down arrow in the Account field to access a pop-up window with more financial dimension fields.
  
  
  
    Use the scroll bar in the pop-up window to scroll down and finish populating the remaining financial dimensions required for the purchase, e.g., D3, D4, D5, D6, etc.
    As you click in each field, a menu of selectable entries displays in the pane on the left.
    Remember, any financial dimensions set up when the project was created will default here and should not be changed.
    Click anywhere outside of the pop-up window to close it and return to the PR lines.
  
  
  Time-saving tip! The contents of Account field can be copied and pasted to all lines in the PR (if applicable), eliminating the need to enter the same financial dimensions multiple times!

            Select the relevant location from the drop-down selection list.
            Note: If the item is not going to be placed into inventory, select Non-stock.
          
        
      
    
  
  
    If delivery address requires editing, click the Address tab.
    If applicable, in the Delivery location field, click the drop-down and select an alternate delivery address from the selection list.
  
  The Delivery name and the Attention information fields may also be populated/updated as required. These are free text fields.

  Recall a PR from Workflow to Make Changes
  Purpose
  Use this procedure to recall a PR from workflow after it has been submitted for approval. This may be required if an error was made on initial creation or the PR and must be changed, or the PR is no longer required.
  A PR can only be recalled if it has status, In review. Once a PR is successfully recalled from workflow, the PR status changes back to Draft. Changes to a PR can only be done for a PR with Draft status.
  Once changes are made, the PR must be resubmitted to workflow.
