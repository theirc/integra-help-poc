  Overview
  The Integra system has many tabular grid screens for viewing and entering information. Some examples are, All purchase orders grid, Vouchers grid, All projects grid. There are default grid layouts automatically applied by the Integra system but often these default layouts contain columns that are not applicable to a user or they may be missing columns that would be valuable for a user. As such, the system allows a user to customize the grid layout to suit their personal needs. This document contains the following step-by-step procedures for customizing a grid layout.
  
    Adding and hiding columns
    Moving column positions within the table grid
    Activating the footer on a table grid to display additional information such as grand totals for numeric fields
    Saving and naming a layout for a unique purpose
    Setting a layout as the default display each time the screen is accessed
  
  Using the All projects grid as a sample, the screenshot below identifies access points to the personalization features.
  
  Additional Notes:
  
    A personalized layout can be saved with any name. It defaults to “My view” but this text can be overwritten with any text.
    An asterisk next to the view name indicates a change has been made to the layout currently displayed. The change must be saved in order to have the changes available for future use.
    Columns widths can be changed by dragging the double-sided arrow that appears when you hover the mouse on the border between two column headers.  This is useful to see full descriptions when the default width is too small.
