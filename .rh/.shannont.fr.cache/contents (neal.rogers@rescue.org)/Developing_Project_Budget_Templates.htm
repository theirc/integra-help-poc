  Business Process Information
  This section outlines key terms and business process information for developing project budget templates for Integra.
  Project Setup Process Flow
  Process Diagram Notes: 
  Step 4: Not applicable to RAI or OFR as only standard project categories are used.
  Step 6: This task may not be used until a future date.
  General Guidelines for Budget Development
  
    Finance, budget holders, and delegates, work together to develop the budgets. 
    Finance is responsible for populating the budget registers, assigning the project categories, and setting donor funding limits. 
    Project budgets are submitted to Workflow for approval by Finance.
    Funding limits are not applicable to unrestricted and temporary restricted projects.
  
  Project Stages
  The table below describes the usage of the various stages that are automatically and manually applied to a project in Integra. 
  
    
      
        
          Stage
        
        
          Usage
        
      
      
        
          New on-hold
        
        
          This stage is automatically applied to all new projects in Integra and is brought over from OTIS. 
        
      
      
        
          Active
        
        
          This stage must be manually applied by Finance when the project setup is complete. This status is required in order to be able to perform transactions against the project.
        
      
      
        
          Budget Revision
        
        
          This status is automatically applied to a project when the “Budget Revision” checkbox is selected in OTIS by Grants staff. It serves as a communication/prompt to the Finance team to revise the budget in a timely manner.  
          All functionality is still available on the project with this status.  
        
      
      
        
          Liquidation
        
        
          This status is manually applied when project is in liquidation phase.
        
      
      
        
          Closed
        
        
          This stage is manually applied by HQ when project is officially complete. Transactions cannot be posted to a project with this status. Once a  project is closed, it cannot be reopened.
        
      
      
        
          Temporarily Suspended
        
        
          This status is manually applied if a project needs to be put on hold temporarily for a specific reason.
        
      
    
  
  Sub-projects in Integra
  Integra is using sub-projects in the following two ways:
  
    To identify subaward sub-projects
    To Identify non-subaward sub-projects
  
  Both types of sub-projects are auto-assigned a D1 extension code (a numeric value tagged onto the end of the project ID). The example below highlights the naming convention relative to the project ID/D1.
  
  The two types of sub-projects get created in Integra as outlined below:
  
    A subaward sub-project D1 extension code is created centrally in OTIS and automatically flows to Integra via the OTIS/Integra interface.
      
        A D1 extension is required for all subaward su-projects, regardless of the subaward budget value
      
    
    A non-subaward sub-project D1 extension code is created manually in the relevant Integra reporting entity.
  
  IMPORTANT: As Integra only allows one naming convention, Finance teams must ensure the description of the sub-project clearly distinguishes between an organization name and a field site or program sector.
  Developing Donor Asset Budget Lines
  All fixed assets that are expensed to a project must be assigned a project category that is linked to a “Donor Asset Group”. This is done during project setup when project categories are either assigned (standard categories) or are created (unique categories). The process achieves the same objective and assigns a donor asset group to a specific project category. However, the steps to assign the donor asset group differs for the Unique Category Project Budget Development Template and the Standard Category Budget Development Template.
  Unique Category Project Budget Development Template: This template is mainly used in CRRD where donor reporting formats are determined by the donor. If there are project budget lines set up to procure donor assets in the project budget, the Unique Categories Project Budget Development Template automatically assigns the “Donor Asset Group” in the Project Category worksheet when the following main accounts are entered into the Data Source tab.
  
    
      
        
          Main Account

          CIKASSETNO
        
      
    
  
  The project categories tagged with the “Donor Asset Group” (from table above) will be uploaded into Integra. The relevant project category is selected at the time of procuring the asset and the asset tag (from the Asset Group table above) on the project category will flow through to the purchase order.
  Once the asset has been received and the product receipt has been recorded in Integra, the system will automatically create the asset record in the Fixed Assets module and will assign a penny value to the asset.

  Using the Budget Template
  
    The Budget Development Template is a standardized template used to develop and amend project budgets.
    Two different budget development templates have been designed to accommodate the following types of projects. Ensure the correct template is used!
      
    
  
  1. Standard Project Category Budget Template
  - Used for projects that use standard project categorie
  2. Unique Project Category Budget Template 
  - Used for projects that use unique project categories
  
    All unrestricted projects use standard project categories
    Temporary restricted may use either standard or unique project categories; this is based on the reporting needs of each specific project.
    Restricted projects may use unique or standard project categories. Examples of when each would primarily be used are listed below.
      
        US Gov – use standard project categories
        European (ECHO funding) - use unique project categories
      
    
  
  
    The budget templates contain numerous queries and formulas that streamline the population of the project files that get generated and uploaded to Integra. 
  
  
    Be sure to read ALL the information on the Instructions sheet in the Budget Template. (1st tab in file)
  
  Guidance for Applying Project Categories and 
  Please refer to the following documents on RescueNet for detailed guidance:

  Procedures
  Populate the Budget Template
  Purpose
  Use the Budget Template workbook to help build your office’s project budget for Integra. The template has numerous queries and formulas that streamline the population of the project files that get uploaded to Integra.
  IMPORTANT: All instructions for completing the template are outlined on the Instructions tab in the template itself.
  Guidance for Populating the Budget Template
  
    Download the relevant budget development template from the target Box location.
      
      Integra Templates à Financeà Project Setup-Templates à Project Setup – Blank Template à [select relevant template].
    
    Review the Instructions tab carefully before proceeding. Continue referring back to the Instructions tab as you proceed with populating the template.
    Populate the Budget Development Template according to instructions embedded in the actual template file.
  
  Note: The Project Category List tab  is a reference page to ensure  the correct values are used.
  Next Steps
  Once the Budget Template has been completed and reviewed, and the various project templates that get uploaded to Integra have been generated, i.e., project categories, budget register, and funding limits, the templates can be uploaded to Integra by Finance.
    ‎
  Upload Completed Project Templates to Integra 
  Purpose
  Finance uses this procedure to upload the completed templates to Box.
  Steps
  
    Using the standard file upload function in Box, upload the completed template to the target Box location.
    Validate the file has disappeared from the Box folder. This indicates the upload has taken place.
    Review the email sent that indicates if the upload was successful or not.
    View/validate the uploaded information in Integra.
