  Travel Advance Request - Business Process
  
  The Expense Management module in Integra is used to create and approve travel advance requests. Payment of the travel advance is also recorded in Integra.
  Users create Travel Expense Reports (TERs) in Integra and submit them to their supervisors or department heads for online approval.
  Clearly legible scanned receipts and any other documents and comments required for verification of expenses are attached to the expense reports in the system.

  Expense Report - Business Process 
  
  IRC employees request reimbursement for out-of-pocket travel expenses by submitting an expense report. Provide complete, accurate details and clear legible receipts or other supporting documents and comments for a supervisor to verify expenses that need to be reimbursed.
  Users create Travel Expense Reports (TERs) in Integra and submit to their supervisors or department heads for online approval.
  General Tips for Entering Expenses
  
    Clearly legible scanned receipts and any other documents and comments required for verification of expenses are attached to each expense report.
    Always adhere to the Global Travel Policy on RescueNet.
    Consult the Fiscal Year Per Diem Rates to stay within the maximum allowable lodging cost specific to a destination.
    Follow per diem rules for meals and incidental expenses in a travel location and the rules for partial per diem allowance on the day of departure and return.
    Always charge the expenses to the correct budget.
    If you must book a hotel on a card, for emergency cases only, you must obtain a receipt from the hotel.
    Submit documentation within 2 weeks after the end of a trip.
    Enter multiple expenses on one expense report.
  
  Entering Expense Transaction Lines - Receipts
  
    Ensure all expenses over $25 have a receipt; the date and amount must be clear.
    All expenses, over or under $25, must include a detailed comment for the transaction.
    Each receipt per line contains only the receipt for the charge; do not put more than one receipt on a scanned pdf.
    Ensure the receipt is clear and legible.
    If you do not have a clear or legible receipt:
      
        Either alter the receipt if appropriate – e.g., the date is slightly unclear; do not do this if the amount is unclear.
        OR upload an alternate form of proof such as a copy of bank statement, email from supervisor.
      
    
    If you are unable to attain a receipt for transport, request a business card from a taxi driver with the total charge written on it.
    Ensure each expense report is in USD.
    If receipts are not in USD, upload a screenshot of the Oanda Exchange Rate Calculator.
    If you use an Oanda exchange rate calculation, the date of the converter must be the same date as the receipt.

  Credit Card Expenses - Business Process
     
  
  Integra has a tool for importing credit card transactions from a statement. This is used for Corporate Credit cards and for Procurement cards (P-cards). Once transactions are imported into Integra, they are attached to an expense report and charged to the correct project and category, along with the applicable financial dimensions.
  P-card transactions and RESCUE Corporate Card transactions must be added and coded on separate expense reports. Do not combine these transactions on the same report.
  Intercompany Expense Reports - Business Process
  
  IRC employees request reimbursement for out-of-pocket intercompany expenses.
  Intercompany expense lines are created when an expense is incurred on behalf of another main office. Sub-offices in the same reporting entity in Integra do not require an intercompany expense line. There are two types of intercompany expenses:
  
    Intercompany expense to record expense in another reporting entity:
    Both offices are on Integra
    Interim intercompany expense:
    Expense incurred for a reporting entity that is not yet live on Integra.
    Uses ICCO to indicate the interim company.
    The destination company is identified in this expense line.
