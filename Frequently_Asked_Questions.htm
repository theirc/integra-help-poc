    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I scan and upload a document to Integra?</h3>
    <p>There are two options to scan and upload a document to the system.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Option 1: </span>Using your mobile device, take a photo of the document (e.g., receipt) and email it to yourself. Next, save the attachment locally to your computer. Then, locate the transaction (e.g., expense report) in Integra, and select either the paperclip icon on the form, or the “Upload Receipt” button.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Option 2:</span> Using a printer in your office, scan and email a copy of the document (e.g., receipt) to yourself. Next, save the attachment locally to your computer. Then, locate the transaction (e.g., expense report) in Integra, and select either the paper clip icon on the form, or the “Upload Receipt” button.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I change the email notification settings related to Integra?</h3>
    <ol class="Decimal">
      <li>Click <span style="font-weight:bold;">Settings </span>(located in the top right of the Dashboard).</li>
      <li>Select <span style="font-weight:bold;">User Options</span>.</li>
      <li>Under <span style="font-weight:bold;">Options</span>, select <span style="font-weight:bold;">Workflow</span>.</li>
      <li>Using the toggle, choose <span style="font-weight:bold;">Yes </span>or No to send notifications in email.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I change the flow for approvals in Integra?</h3>
    <p>The approval process and authorization matrix are set up in Integra as systematic workflows. This ensures that the processes are followed consistently. When a process requires approval, the workflow determines which roles can approve. For example, if you are a budget holder, you will be assigned a system security role that allows you to approve requests for purchases.</p>
    <p>To request a change of security, submit a request via the <a href="https://nethope.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_id%3Dbea965611b7264102cac9938b04bcba7%26sysparm_link_parent%3D703d3aa8dbbf4050658c7bedae9619a8%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_default%26sysparm_view%3Dcatalog_default">Change Integra Access Form</a>.

Your request will be reviewed by the Integra team. In some cases, the request will also be reviewed by the hiring manager or leadership level staff member.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">What languages does Integra support? How do I change the language in the system?</h3>
    <p>The Integra Project Team understands that staff at the IRC speak and work in multiple languages. The chosen Microsoft ERP software solution has the capability to translate core elements (i.e., labels and headings) into 40 different languages. Decisions on additional translation capability (e.g., language of transaction descriptions, purchase orders, global pharmaceutical lists, etc.) will be made as the team’s work progresses.</p>
    <p>The Settings menu includes several User Options, including language preference. To change the language in the system, please follow these steps in Integra, starting from the Integra Dashboard (Home page):</p>
    <ol class="Decimal">
      <li>Click <span style="font-weight:bold;">Settings </span>(located in the top right of the Dashboard).</li>
      <li>Select <span style="font-weight:bold;">User Options</span>.</li>
      <li>Under <span style="font-weight:bold;">Options</span>, select <span style="font-weight:bold;">Preferences</span>.</li>
      <li>Under <span style="font-weight:bold;">Language and Country/Region Preferences</span>, select the drop-down arrow in the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Language </span>field.</li>
      <li>Select the language of choice.</li>
      <li>Click <span style="font-weight:bold;">Save </span>in the top left of the screen.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">RESULT</span>: The language will change labels and headings only. The language will NOT change for the standard data that appears in drop-down fields or for “open text” fields.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I change the currency in Integra? [Non-RAI users only]</h3>
    <p>On any transaction form, select the drop-down in the currency field to process a transaction in a different currency. Please note: the base currency for the IRC is US Dollars.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Is it possible to personalize/customize my Integra layout?</h3>
    <p>Yes, it is possible to save personalized layouts to best fit the actions you perform in Integra. For detailed instructions, please see <a href="http://s2.bl-1.com/h/cWJjjXmN?url=https://rescue.box.com/s/dkxr7yvv43n1mdjo1l1pzd3r3g8cdoph">this reference guide</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How will I be notified of updates to Integra?</h3>

    <h3 class="Heading3">I don’t see all the functions I need to carry out my task in Integra. What do I do?</h3>
    <p>System security roles are assigned to Integra users based on the work they do as part of their job. If you feel you are missing access to the functions (specific modules, applications and tiles) in Integra, please submit a request via the <a href="https://nethope.service-now.com/com.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do?v=1&amp;sysparm_id=7de125eadb9623402762fd7aae9619a1&amp;sysparm_catalog_view=catalog_default&amp;glide_sso_id=98f233b8dbd2db00f5535e65ce96192c">Integra Help Form</a>. The support staff will work with you and your manager to obtain the necessary approval for access.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Which standard IRC business applications interface with Integra?</h3>
    <p>Some existing IRC applications will interface with Integra. Please see <a href="https://rescue.app.box.com/s/lo7xutxozz5ehjrfqjod28bjcf9wk0kw">this document</a> for a listing of updates/changes being made to these applications so they align with Integra and the new business processes.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Will enhancement requests sent to Integra Support be implemented?</h3>
    <p>All enhancement requests are logged and prioritized by the Integra Team. Critical enhancements put into effect will be communicated via the Integra SuperUsers, or by email.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Assets_(for_CRRD_Users)"></a>Assets (for CRRD Users)</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">A new asset received by the procurement team does not appear in Integra’s Fixed Assets Module. What should I do?</h3>
    <p>If the asset was procured through via purchase requisition, the D4 owner or local Supply Chain should confirm with Finance that the correct asset group has been assigned. assigned the correct asset group when reviewing the PR. If the asset was procured via Item Forecast, the D4 owner or local Supply Chain should confirm with Finance that the correct Project Category is linked to the Fixed Assets module. (NOTE: Capitalized fixed assets cannot be procured via the Item Forecast.)</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">What documents should be attached to a fixed asset record in Integra?</h3>
    <p>An equipment issue form, warrantee, technical sheet, or donation or disposal certificates are examples of the documents that may be needed, depending on the type of asset.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">When should an Integra asset record be updated?</h3>
    <p>An asset record should be updated under the following circumstances: When a new asset is received; when the location of an asset is changed from one office to the other; when an asset is transferred from one office to another; when the status of the asset changes (e.g., asset becomes damaged, lost, disposed, donated, etc.).</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="ATC_Checks_for_Vendor_Groups"></a>ATC Checks for Vendor Groups</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I run an ATC check for a trade vendor?</h3>
    <p>If the anticipated annual spend is greater than $2500, Global Supply Chain will raise an ATC for the vendor once the new vendor forms have been submitted. (For more information on vendor creation, see the Vendors: General Questions section of this FAQ.) An ATC check is no necessary for vendors if the anticipated annual spend is less than $2500.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I run an ATC check for an individual consultant?</h3>
    <p>As of February 3, 2020, an interim process for engaging individual consultants is in effect. For more information, please see the <a href="https://rescuenet.rescue.org/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=1653&amp;SearchId=">Engaging Individual Consultants</a> page on RescueNet.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I run an ATC check for a sub-awardee?</h3>
    <p>Currently, ATC checks for sub-awardees cannot be run via the Integra-ATC interface. Please continue to raise ATC requests via the <a href="https://atc.rescue.org/accounts/login/?next=/request/">ATC portal</a>. Once you’ve received ATC approval via email, forward this email to <a href="mailto:appsupport@rescue.org">appsupport@rescue.org</a>. The support team will notify you when the ATC details have been uploaded to Integra and the new sub-awardee vendor can become part of the appropriate workflow. For more detailed instructions, please see the <a href="https://rescue.box.com/s/wi181zht6oal50f46d797sjgzsgciir1">Grants Master Data Management Integra User Guide</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Does Integra generate notifications for expired ATC checks?</h3>
    <p>Integra does not generate notifications for expired ATC checks. Global Supply Chain is responsible for monitoring expirations on ATC checks, and renewing those that have expired.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I pay a sub-awardee vendor that is currently on hold in Integra?</h3>
    <p>If you need to pay a sub-awardee that has a vendor record on hold in Integra, please contact appsupport@rescue.org. Please do not submit the record to workflow. In most cases, if a sub-awardee vendor record is not active in the 9IRC legal entity (for HQ), or 6DAT legal entity (for Atlanta), it means there are no active sub-awards for that legal entity with that vendor and/or that the vendor’s ATC details have not been loaded into Integra. If your office is paying one of these vendors, you will need to provide the most recent ATC clearance email to remove the hold from the vendor record.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Several vendors in Integra are currently on hold because of an expired Anti-Terrorism Check (ATC). How do I update vendors with expired ATCs?</h3>
    <p>Expired ATCs are updated by the Master Data Management (MDM) Team, who are responsible running yearly ATCs. If you see ATCs that haven’t been updated in Integra, please ask one of your office vendor creators to contact the MDM team via ServiceNow, so they can be corrected.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="BvA_and_Other_Financial_Reports"></a>BvA and Other Financial Reports</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I access BvA and other financial reports?</h3>
    <p>BvA reports, as well as other Integra reports, can be accessed via Power BI, a Microsoft business analytics and reporting tool that serves as an add-on to Integra. It supplements Integra’s reports by providing users with the ability to retrieve data from a variety of sources (Integra and ISUN), and organize and structure the data into hierarchies. It creates visual reports that will help us identify and share insights, and drive better decision-making. For more information on Power BI, please see the <a href="https://rescue.box.com/s/du5xprjwa6hjx3s45d89d12v6qwlavmi">Power BI FAQ</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I log in to Power BI?</h3>
    <p>To log in to Power BI, go to the <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">Power BI website</a>. In the upper-right corner, click Sign in, and log in with your IRC username (email) and password.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I access Integra reports in Power BI?</h3>
    <p>For step-by-step instructions on accessing reports in Power BI, please see the <a href="https://rescue.box.com/s/6f9hol1cptduxxxew8qalmc1kjaa6t50">How to Access Your Power BI Reports quick reference guide</a>. This guide also contains instructions on filtering reports and bookmarking pages in Power BI.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I gain permission to access Power BI?</h3>
    <p>Staff who frequently work with expense reports and BvA data – e.g., grant coordinators, program managers and unrestricted budget owners – currently use Power BI to view Integra reports. Users are assigned roles in Power BI based on the data for which they need access (i.e., relevant D4 code data). If you believe you need access to Power BI, please fill out an <a href="https://nethope.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_id%3D0319bc321b40781083121173b24bcbee%26sysparm_link_parent%3Dd252320ec611227a011e082eb439e5f6%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_default%26sysparm_view%3Dcatalog_default">Integra Reporting with Power BI Access Form</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I reconcile the General Ledger with a specific sub-ledger?</h3>
    <p>Finance is responsible for ensuring that all general ledger accounts match the balances of the assigned sub-ledger accounts. If all information is posted from the sub-ledgers to the general ledger, balances will match. Discrepancies between a sub-ledger and the general ledger may arise if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Entries<span> posted in the sub-ledger are adjusted/corrected at the general ledger level</span></li>
      <li><span>Entries posted to the sub-ledger control account in the general ledger.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is recommended that Finance regularly review all general ledger accounts to ensure the control account does not allow direct posting to the general ledger. This will help prevent any discrepancies between sub-ledger and general ledger.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Contributions-in-Kind"></a>Contributions-in-Kind</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Can I receive and distribute CIK inventory items through Integra?</h3>
    <p>Integra’s <span style="font-weight:bold;">Inventory Management</span> module should be used to distribute CIK items tracked in inventory. Items not tracked in inventory should be distributed using the <span style="font-weight:bold;">expense journal</span> in Integra. For more details, please see this <a href="https://rescue.box.com/s/ik2r7g8taixx7g7rm9jym6zdh0toh8xo">user guide</a>. When distributing CIK items in Integra, please be sure to input the correct codes.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Contractors_and_Consultants"></a>Contractors and Consultants</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">What is the process for engaging individual consultants?</h3>
    <p>As of February 3, 2020, a new process for engaging individual consultants is in effect.</p>
    <p>If you are a Requester who plans to engage an individual consultant while the interim process is in effect, the process’s key requirements are as follows:</p>
    <p>A purchase requisition (PR) and purchase order (PO) is not required when engaging individual consultants. Note, a PR and PO continues to be required for <a href="https://rescuenet.rescue.org/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=1490&amp;SearchId=">service contracts</a> (i.e., engaging consulting companies/firms).</p>
    <p>The Individual Consultant must complete a Vendor Information Form at the time the formal offer is extended, and the Requester must submit the completed form to the GSC Data Management Team (via the <a href="https://nethope.service-now.com/com.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do?v=1&amp;sysparm_id=7de125eadb9623402762fd7aae9619a1&amp;sysparm_catalog_view=catalog_default&amp;glide_sso_id=98f233b8dbd2db00f5535e65ce96192c">Integra Help Form</a>).</p>
    <p>The Individual Consultant must email invoices for processing (per the agreed payment terms) to AP (<a href="mailto:IRC.AccountsPayable@rescue.org">IRC.AccountsPayable@rescue.org</a>) and cc the Hiring Manager.</p>
    <p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://rescuenet.rescue.org/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=1653&amp;SearchId=">Engaging Individual Consultants</a> page on RescueNet.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I pay service contracts in Integra? How do I close out service contracts that end without the full intended hours completed (e.g., there are ten hours in a purchase order, but it takes eight hours to complete the work)?</h3>
    <p>For service contracts, the user in charge of the Purchase Order (PO) needs to process PO receipts for time or deliverables rather than the full PO. If work ends with fewer hours than expected, follow the steps below to close out the contract:</p>
    <ol class="Decimal">
      <li>Go to the line item in PO for Service.</li>
      <li>Select <span style="font-weight:bold;">Update line</span>.</li>
      <li>Select <span style="font-weight:bold;">Deliver remainder</span>. The amount remaining to be received should appear.</li>
      <li>Select <span style="font-weight:bold;">Cancel quantity</span>.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Delegation_of_Workflow_and_Work_Items"></a>Delegation of Workflow and Work Items</h2>
    <p>Integra enables users to delegate work in the following three ways:</p>
    <ol class="Decimal">
      <li>Delegate workflows to an authorized employee</li>
      <li>Delegate approval of a specific PO</li>
      <li>Create and submit an expense report on behalf of another employee</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For Travel and Expense Reports (TER) to be processed quickly and efficiently, they must be prepared correctly and properly reviewed by your supervisor. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Please be sure to include the D7 (employee ID) for the staff member who incurred the expense on all expense reports and IRC Corporate Card/P-card transactions.</span> Incomplete, late, and incorrect TER submissions to Accounts Payable (AP) have contributed to delays in processing payments. To help prevent future TER rejections, AP has prepared a list of <a href="http://s.bl-1.com/h/cD5gDBsk?url=https://rescue.box.com/s/swm6hp48eepxmd4rmpqtwcgtsvgbp41x">Top Tips for Submitting Your TER</a>. For help tracking the status of your expense report, please see the Tracking Purchase Requests, Expense Reports, and Other Items section of this FAQ.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How should documents be submitted for reimbursement be formatted?</h3>
    <p>When providing documents for reimbursement, please upload all necessary documents in a single PDF. This will significantly reduce processing time. Please do not provide multiple attachments (i.e., separate files for vouchers, invoices and receipts).</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How can I confirm that my expense report has been paid?</h3>
    <p>Beginning September 2019, HQ and RAI staff who have submitted Travel and Expense Reports (TER) for reimbursement have begun receiving payment notifications when Accounts Payable (AP) makes payment on these reports. Every Thursday, AP will send payment confirmations for all TER submitted and processed by 12 PM Wednesday. Staff will need to wait approximately 2 business days before funds are credited to their personal bank accounts.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Is it possible to split an individual charge to different HQ-codes in Integra?</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">P-cards only</span>, select the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Split </span>button in the main Expense Report screen to charge to different projects. (Please note that Integra does not allow you to split multiple P-card charges simultaneously.) To split a non-P-card transaction, create separate lines or each project in your expense report. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Do not </span>use the Distribute Amounts button to charge to different codes.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I submit an expense report on a colleague’s behalf?</h3>
    <p>For instructions on submitting an expense report on a colleague’s behalf, please see Initiate an Expense Report for Another Employee in the <a href="https://rescue.box.com/s/g2f9viax57z1fxh7wsv8ll1y4rzkwpre">Expense Management User Guide</a>. You can view all assigned expense reports in a list page by navigating to <span style="font-weight:bold;">Expense management &gt; My expenses &gt; Expenses delegated to me</span>.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">My expense report was rejected because the receipt was illegible. Is there a way around this?</h3>
    <p>If your receipt is difficult to read, please provide a credit card or bank statement as further evidence of the transaction. It is recommended that you also provide a comment in Integra explaining why you are including the credit card or bank statement</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Are there default dimensions that can reduce the number of entries needed when processing expense reports? [RAI users only]</h3>
    <p>There are several ways to default dimensions in Integra to make processing transactions easier. Most are at the discretion of the local finance manager.</p>
    <p>Default dimensions are determined by the project. For example, since there is only one Program Area (D3) used in conjunction with the dimension GB751, this dimension can be defaulted on the project; this means that each time a transaction for GB751 is processed, the D3 is populated automatically.</p>
    <p>If your Operating Unit (D4) has only 1 location (e.g., Boise), the D4 can also be defaulted on all projects.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Are RAI caseworkers who travel frequently required to use Integra’s mileage reimbursement feature?</h3>
    <p>RAI caseworkers who travel frequently can continue to log their mileage and obtain reimbursement outside Integra.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Can Interns obtain reimbursement using Integra?</h3>
    <p>Interns do not have Integra access. Supervisors calculate interns’ reimbursements manually, then submit reimbursements on behalf of their interns in Integra.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I process IRC Corporate Card transactions in Integra?</h3>
    <p>For more information on the IRC Corporate Card, please see the <a href="https://rescuenet.rescue.org/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=12779&amp;SearchId=1607771">IRC Corporate Card page on RescueNet</a> or email Tr easury Services (<a href="mailto:irccorporatecard@rescue.org">irccorporatecard@rescue.org</a>).</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Where can I view transactions that have been posted (including account codes and financial dimensions)?</h3>
    <p>Navigate to <span style="font-weight:bold;">General Ledger &gt; Journal Entries &gt; Inquiries and Reports &gt;</span>. Depending on the transaction, select <span style="font-weight:bold;">Trial Balance, Accounting Source Explorer</span> or <span style="font-weight:bold;">Voucher Transactions</span>.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Where can I find more information about processing expense reports?</h3>
    <p>For more information about processing expense reports, please visit the <a href="https://rescuenet.rescue.org/Interact/Pages/Section/ContentListing.aspx?subsection=10354">Accounts Payable page on RescueNet</a>. </p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="ETO_Integration_for_RAI_Users"></a>ETO Integration for RAI Users</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">What are the advantages to the ETO/Integra integration?</h3>
    <p>Beginning September 2020, the ETO/Integra integration will allow for improved visibility into third-party payments, payment processing, and inventory distribution for our RAI staff and clients. The relevant training materials have been updated.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I process client payments via the ETO/Integra integration?</h3>
    <p>When processing client payments, it is important that program areas selected in Integra correspond with the ETO program tag on the Project Code (D1). This will ensure transactions transfer correctly from Integra to ETO.</p>
    <p>Also, the correct combination of D1, D3 and D9 must be used in Integra to ensure touchpoints are created in ETO. The ETO program tag on the D1 must match the client’s programmatic enrollment indicated by the Client ID (D9), and include a Program Area (D3) associated with the ETO program tag.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note</span>: As of October 1, 2021, the Client ID is its own field on each transaction. It is no longer a Financial Dimension. Client ID codes and values are not changing, and processes will remain the same, except where you enter and see the Client ID in each transaction. This enhancement will make searching easier, help reduce errors, and improve reporting.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Financ"></a>Finance: Coding, Funding and Transactions</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Where can I find guidance on inputting the correct financial codes into Integra?</h3>
    <p>With the go-live of Integra, the organization is transitioning from T-codes (used in SUN) to D-codes (used in Integra). Integra users should refer to the <a href="https://rescuenet.rescue.org/Interact/Pages/Section/ContentListing.aspx?subsection=3818">Financial Accounting Structure page on RescueNet</a> for coding guidance.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How does the transition from SUN systems to Integra affect the codes we use?</h3>
    <p>Until that transition from SUN to Integra has been completed, the IRC will be using both financial systems at the same time. Each system has its own transaction coding structure – SUN Transaction codes (T-codes) and Integra Dimension codes (D-codes).</p>
    <p>Beginning October 1, 2020, to minimize confusion and administrative burden, certain T-codes are being changed to their D-code equivalents.</p>
    <p>The T-codes affected are the SUN T3/T5/T6 code values. While the code values will change, the purpose and usage of the codes will not change. SUN and all other systems that use T-codes (e.g., SUN, BvA, SCAN, TETRA, etc.), will be updated to accept the new code values and all historical data will be updated in these systems to reflect the new code values.</p>
    <p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://rescuenet.rescue.org/Interact/Pages/Section/SubFullOne.aspx?subsection=3818">Financial Accounting Structure page on RescueNet</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">I work in HQ Finance. How do I process transactions related to field offices that are using Integra?</h3>
    <p>Each field office will have its own legal entity (D5) set up in when the office goes begins using the system. When Integra goes live in a field office, HQ Finance will receive a communication informing them of the office’s legal entity. To process transactions related a specific office, select the relevant D5 under the Legal Entity drop-down when in 9IRC in Integra.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Is the T4 (expenditure location) code available in Integra?</h3>
    <p>In Integra’s <span style="font-weight:bold;">General ledger </span>module, the T4 code (expenditure location) is located in each transaction line, under the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Description</span> field on the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Voucher transactions</span> list page. To access the Voucher transactions list page in Integra, go to <span style="font-weight:bold;">Navigation pane &gt; Modules &gt; General ledger &gt; Inquires and reports &gt; Voucher transactions</span></p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I enter the Client ID in Integra?</h3>
    <p>Beginning October 1, 2021, the Client ID will be its own field on each transaction. This means the Client ID will no longer be recognized as the D9 Financial Dimension code. Instead, it will be entered as a separate, Client ID data-only field on each transaction. A separate field for the Client ID makes finding and selecting this critical information faster and easier.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I enter the Fixed Asset ID in Integra?</h3>
    <p>Beginning October 1, 2021, the Fixed Asset ID is its own field on relevant forms and templates. It is no longer recognized as the D10 Financial Dimension code. Instead of entering the Fixed Asset code as a D10 code, it is entered in a new and separate Fixed Asset ID-only field.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Is the month closed by the Legal Entity, or by HQ?</h3>
    <p>Month end is closed centrally at HQ, with a cutoff date of the 13th of each month for all legal entities.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How are funding limits currently determined in Integra?</h3>
    <p>Funding limits are determined by the total budget for a given project.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Inventory_(for_CRRD_users)"></a>Inventory (for CRRD users)</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Once Integra is live, how will warehouse staff be notified of a dispatch request?</h3>
    <p>When a dispatch is requested, program staff will share a signed picking list with warehouse staff (either by email or hard copy).</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Is a waybill required when dispatching items from a warehouse?</h3>
    <p>Until further notice, a waybill is required if dispatching an item via individual staff member. If the item(s) are being collected directly by program staff, a waybill is not required – a signed packing slip is sufficient.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How long can local Supply Chain keep items returned from distribution to a warehouse before returning these items to on-hand inventory?</h3>
    <p>72 working hours is the maximum transit period for items returned from distribution to remain in on-hand inventory.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Where are items being transferred from one IRC warehouse to another listed in Integra?</h3>
    <p>These items are listed in the Transit Warehouse, which can be accessed from the on-hand inventory report.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">When an item is transferred from one location to another within an IRC warehouse, how do I change the inventory location in Integra?</h3>
    <p>In an Integra transfer journal, change the inventory location to the new location within the warehouse.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">What is the effect of having an open (not posted) counting journal in an IRC warehouse?</h3>
    <p>Having an open counting journal in Integra will prevent users from performing any receiving transactions on warehouses/locations being counted. (NOTE: During annual inventory, all locations are being counted. If an open journal is posted during annual inventory, receiving transactions will be blocked on all locations.)</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">What documents should be attached to a counting journal before it is posted?</h3>
    <p>A scanned copy of the signed counting list in which the quantities counted are recorded should be attached to a counting journal before posting.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Invoices"></a>Invoices</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I process vendor invoices at HQ?</h3>
    <p>All vendor invoices must be submitted electronically to <a href="mailto:IRC.AccountsPayable@rescue.org">IRC.AccountsPayable@rescue.org</a> by the vendor. The name of the vendor should appear in the email subject line. All submitted invoices should include the Purchase Order number. If vendors need to submit invoices on paper, they should send invoices to the following address:</p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 0.50in;">ATTN: Accounts Payable</p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 0.50in;">122 East 42<sup>nd</sup> Street</p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 0.50in;">New York, NY 10168</p>
    <p>Vendors should direct all questions to <a href="mailto:IRC.AccountsPayable@rescue.org">IRC.AccountsPayable@rescue.org</a>.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note: </span>For transactions requiring a PR/PO, any invoices submitted <span style="text-decoration:underline;">without </span>a PR/PO will be rejected by Accounts Payable (AP). The staff member will be notified to rectify before payment is made.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I process vendor invoices in CRRD and RAI offices that are using Integra?</h3>
    <p>Each CRRD and RAI office that uses Integra will have a dedicated email account set up for invoice processing. All vendors who provide goods and services to these offices will be instructed to submit invoices to the appropriate email address. The name of the vendor should appear in the subject line. All submitted invoices should include the Purchase Order number.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">What if there is a discrepancy between an invoice amount and a PO amount?</h3>
    <p>The limits defining the degree of discrepancy that Accounts Payable (AP) will accept between a PO and an invoice are called <span style="font-weight:bold;">tolerances</span>. If an invoice amount is lower than the PO amount, or is higher than the PO amount by up to 5%, the invoice will be paid. If an invoice amount is higher than the PO amount by <span style="font-weight:bold;">more than 5%</span>, the requestor may need to contact the vendor for a revised invoice.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">What should I do if Finance rejects an invoice due to unclear formatting?</h3>
    <p>Please contact the vendor to ensure the invoice formatting is simplified for easy processing by Finance. If you require guidance on simplifying the invoice, please contact your Supply Chain department.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Should invoice journals for HQ payments be prepared in 9IRC after Integra’s go-live date?</h3>
    <p>Yes. HQ payments are always part of the 9IRC legal entity.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I process outstanding invoices from before Integra’s go-live date?</h3>
    <p>All outstanding invoices from before Integra’s go-live date will should be submitted and processed in Integra.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Item_Forecast_for_CRRD_Users"></a>Item Forecast for CRRD Users</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">I have downloaded the Item Forecast template from Integra to Excel, and I’m being prompted to log in. What should I do?</h3>
    <p>Select Log in with organizational account, and log in with your IRC username and password.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">I can’t find my Legal Entity in the summary sheet drop-down menu in Excel. What should I do?</h3>
    <p>Contact your functional SuperUser, your initial, frontline support. Your SuperUser will escalate the issue to the Integra Team if needed.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">My “Get Data” function is taking longer than 15-20 minutes. What should I do?</h3>
    <p>Check with your local IT department to ensure your Internet connection is working properly. If there is no problem with the Internet, please contact your department SuperUser.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">I am populating procurement items in the Item Forecast sheet. I am having trouble finding certain required items. What should I do?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you cannot find the Product ID, contact your local Supply Chain department. You will be guided to the correct Product ID, or a new Product ID will be created by the MDM team.</li>
      <li>If you cannot find the Project ID, Project Category, D3, D4, or D6, contact your local Finance department for assistance.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="Heading3">I am inputting my procurement needs in the Integra Item Forecast module, and I need two different delivery dates for the same product. What should I do?</h3>
    <p>Create each delivery date on a separate line in Integra.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">I’m not sure of my procurement needs on one of the budget lines. What should I do?</h3>
    <p>Enter a budget line into Item Forecast template. Enter the description, and enter the Placeholder Product ID in the Product ID field.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">I’ve uploaded the Item Forecast template to Integra, and the Item Forecast lines do not appear in the Item Forecast module. What should I do?</h3>
    <p>Clear any filters that are applied to the Item Forecast headers in Integra. If this doesn’t work, contact your functional SuperUser.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Can I modify/update my procurement needs in Integra?</h3>
    <p>If the procurement need is still in Draft status in the Item Forecast module, it is possible to modify the Item Forecast lines and submit for approval. If the procurement is in Approved status, contact your local Supply Chain department to modify the procurement need in the Item Requirements module.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Is it possible to delete or cancel an Item Forecast line that has been approved?</h3>
    <p>Approved Item Forecast lines cannot be deleted. Once an Item Forecast line has been approved, Integra automatically creates an item requirement line. To delete/cancel an item requirement line, contact your local Supply Chain department.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">If procurement requires quotations collection, or competitive bidding (e.g., RFQ, RFP), can this process be managed in Integra?</h3>
    <p>RFQ and RFP processes will remain offline (outside Integra) until further notice.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="OTIS_Interface"></a>OTIS Interface</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How does Integra project data relate to data in OTIS?</h3>
    <p>Integra interfaces with OTIS, the IRC’s online system for tracking funding opportunities and sub-grants. Key fields (i.e., start/end dates, budget amount, project name, contract number, etc.) from the OTIS T1 and T7 Overview pages “flow” to that grant’s Project page in Integra. Therefore, the accuracy of project data in Integra is dependent on the accuracy of OTIS data. This applies to both prime awards (T1) and sub-grants (T7).</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="P-Cards"></a>P-Cards</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I import and reconcile P-card charges?</h3>
    <p>To import and reconcile P-card charges, select Add unattached expenses from the banner menu. Select the charges you wish to import into Integra. Complete the process as you would for non-P-card charges. (If you do not see your P-card charges when you select Add unattached expenses, please submit a ticket via the <a href="https://rescuenet.rescue.org/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=11804">Integra Training &amp; Support Page on RescueNe</a>t.) For more information on P-card charges, see Attach Credit Card Transactions in the <a href="https://rescue.box.com/s/gvrjvsmq3rbj76mpn0f50k3k0yylvyt0">Expense Management for Frequent Users user guide</a>. (<span style="font-weight:bold;">Note</span>: P-card transactions submitted on vouchers should be processed in Integra.)</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Is it possible to split an individual charge to different HQ-codes in Integra?</h3>
    <p>Select the Split button in the main Expense Report screen to charge to different projects. (Please note that Integra does not allow you to split multiple P-card charges simultaneously.)</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Receipts"></a>Receipts</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Do all receipts need to be uploaded into Integra?</h3>
    <p>Only receipts for amounts more than $25 (USD) need to be uploaded into Integra. (This includes receipts for purchases made with P-cards.)</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Is it possible to post receipts in a foreign currency? [Non- RAI staff only]</h3>
    <p>If you are posting receipts in a foreign currency, you must use <a href="https://www.oanda.com/us-en/">Oanda</a> to convert the amount into US dollars. Ensure the date on the receipt and the historical date in Oanda conversion are the same. Take a screen shot of the conversion in Oanda, and then upload <span style="text-decoration:underline;">both </span>the receipt and the screen shot into Integra. (<span style="font-weight:bold;">Note</span>: The currency default of US dollars on the expense report line in Integra should <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not be</span> changed. If this currency default is changed, you will receive an error when trying to submit your expense report.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Shared_Program_Costs"></a>Shared Program Costs</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Should budgets for Shared Program Costs (SPCs) be uploaded to Integra?</h3>
    <p>Yes. The rollout of Integra does not impact policy regarding SPCs. In Integra, SPC budgets are uploaded in one line using standard Project Categories. (NOTE: The tool used to allocate expenses in Integra has been customized for the system, and differs from the tool allocation tool previously used in SUN. This tool will be shared with country offices before they begin using Integra.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Sub-Projects_and_Sub-Awardee_Vendors"></a>Sub-Projects and Sub-Awardee Vendors</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I create a new sub-awardee vendor?</h3>
    <p>New sub-awardee vendor records should only be created under the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You cannot find a partner record in OTIS to which to assign your sub-award opportunity, and/or:</li>
      <li>You cannot find the appropriate vendor record to be paid in Integra.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please refer to the <a href="https://rescue.box.com/s/wi181zht6oal50f46d797sjgzsgciir1">Grants Master Data Management Integra User Guide</a> for instructions on creating a new sub-awardee vendor record in Integra.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I run an ATC for a sub-awardee?</h3>
    <p>Currently, ATC checks for sub-awardees cannot be run via the Integra-ATC interface. Please continue to raise ATC requests via the <a href="https://atc.rescue.org/accounts/login/?next=/request/">ATC portal</a>. Once you’ve received ATC approval via email, forward this email to <a href="mailto:appsupport@rescue.org">appsupport@rescue.org</a>. The support team will notify you when the ATC details have been uploaded to Integra and the new sub-awardee vendor can become part of the appropriate workflow. For more detailed instructions, please see the Grants Master Data Management Integra User Guide.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I pay a sub-awardee vendor that is currently on hold in Integra?</h3>
    <p>If you need to pay a sub-awardee that has a vendor record on hold in Integra, please contact <a href="mailto:appsupport@rescue.org">appsupport@rescue.org</a>. Please do not submit the record to workflow. In most cases, if a sub-awardee vendor record is not active in the 9IRC legal entity, it means there are no active HQ-managed sub-awards with that vendor and/or that the vendor’s ATC details have not been loaded into Integra. If HQ is paying one of these vendors on behalf of the field, you will need to provide the most recent ATC clearance email to remove the hold from the vendor record.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Is it necessary to request a T7/D1 extension in OTIS in order to see a sub-project for my sub-award in Integra?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Sub-award sub-projects are created automatically in Integra through the OTIS-Integra integration after the OTIS T7 request workflow is completed. Note: T7s for sub-awards will be replaced by D1 extensions in Integra.  D1 extensions should be requested in OTIS for all new sub-awards managed by offices using Integra (currently HQ only), regardless of the sub-award amount. This includes sub-awards amounting to less than 25,000 USD. The documents required for sub-awards amounting to less than 25,000 USD are the same as those for sub-awards amounting to 25,000 USD or more.</p>

    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I track the status of a Purchase Requisition (PR) in Integra?</h3>
    <p>The status of a PR can be viewed by clicking “All purchase requisitions” within the Procurement and sourcing module in Integra. The various statuses that can be assigned to a PR in Integra are listed and defined below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Draft</span>: A PR in Draft status is being worked on by the user/requestor, and still needs to be submitted.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">In review</span>: The D4 owner is reviewing the PR.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Closed</span>: The D4 owner has approved the PR. A draft Purchase Order (PO) has been created and can be accessed.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Approved</span>: If a PR is listed as “approved,” it means the vendor has not been added to the PR, and the PR has not been fully processed. If you see “approved” next to a PR on which you’re working, action is required by the D4 owner to add the vendor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I track the status of a Purchase Order (PO) in Integra?</h3>
    <p>The status of a PO can be seen by clicking All purchase orders in the Procurement and Sourcing module. Each PO is assigned both an <span style="font-weight:bold;">Approval status</span> and a <span style="font-weight:bold;">P</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">urchase order status</span>. The various approval statuses that can be assigned to a PO are listed and defined below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Draft</span>: A PO in Draft approval status needs to be edited by the user/requestor or submitted to workflow. If PO in draft approval status has a purchase order status of <span style="font-weight:bold;">Received</span>, it a means the user has changed the PO, and the PO must be submitted. If the Purchase order status is <span style="font-weight:bold;">Cancelled</span>, it means the user has cancelled the PO.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">In review</span>: The PO is being reviewed by the individual with signing authority.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Approved</span>: The PO has been approved by individual(s) with higher signatory authority, and is ready to be confirmed by the user.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Confirmed</span>: The PO has been confirmed by the user and is ready to be sent to the vendor. If a PO in Confirmed approval status has a purchase order status of <span style="font-weight:bold;">Open order</span>, it means the PO has been sent to the vendor. If the purchase order status is <span style="font-weight:bold;">Received</span>, it means the goods have been received by user. If the purchase order status is <span style="font-weight:bold;">Invoiced</span>, it means AP has posted the vendor invoice against the PO.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Can I upload a document into Integra once a Purchase Order (PO) has been confirmed?</h3>
    <p>Currently, it is not possible to upload documents into Integra once a PO has been confirmed. If you wish to post an invoice in the system at this point in the process, follow the steps below:</p>
    <ol class="Decimal">
      <li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Open the PO and navigate to the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Purchase Order</span> tab.</li>
      <li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">On the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Maintain </span>menu under the Purchase Order tab, select <span style="font-weight:bold;">Request Change</span>. This will update the PO to Draft status, meaning you will be able to attach documents.</li>
      <li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Click the paper clip icon on the top right side of the window. Select <span style="font-weight:bold;">New &gt; File &gt; Browse</span>, and select the document you wish to upload. The document will be uploaded automatically.</li>
      <li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">After attaching the document, you will need to Submit the PO to Workflow, where it will be automatically approved. (If you click the Integra Refresh button, the PO’s approval status will be updated to Confirmed. You may have to click the Integra Refresh button more than once.)</li>
      <li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">You can now confirm a product receipt. For instructions on this process, refer to the <a href="https://rescue.app.box.com/s/cuks94uu3t8nlmgshcx9nzxnbpzpw6zz">Procurement Purchase Requisition to Delivery and Receipt</a> user guide.</li>

    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I track the status of an expense report in Integra? [Non-RAI users only]</h3>
    <p>To view expense reports you’ve submitted, click <span style="font-weight:bold;">My expenses &gt; Expense reports</span> in the Expense Management module. The statuses of the expense reports you’ve submitted are listed and defined below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Draft</span>: An expense report in draft status needs to be edited by the user/requestor.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">In review</span>: The expense report is being reviewed by your supervisor (or, if you are submitting an expense report on a colleague’s behalf, your colleague’s supervisor), or Accounts Payable (AP). To determine which party is reviewing your expense report, click the expense report workflow.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Processed for payment</span>: The expense report has been approved and the payment is waiting to be released.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once the expense report has been paid, the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Payment date</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">Payment voucher</span> columns will be filled out.</p>
    <p>If you are an approver and would like to check the status of expense reports you’ve been asked to approve, click <span style="font-weight:bold;">My expenses &gt; All expense reports</span> in the Expense Management module to see all expense reports in the system. The statuses of the expense reports contained in All expense reports are listed and defined below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Approved</span>: The expense report has been approved, but not processed for payment.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rejected</span>: The user must edit and re-submit the expense report, or the expense report has been cancelled.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Processed for payment</span>: The expense report has been processed and the payment is awaiting release or has been released.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="Heading3">How do I access comments on work items?</h3>
    <p>The comments on Expense Reports, Purchase Requests, and Purchase Orders will enable users to see why they may have been rejected/returned, and the steps required to have them approved. For instructions on accessing these comments see the <a href="https://rescue.box.com/s/5g56gjvxfvx9zx3frfsj6tsvtkg9d2nk">Accessing Comments on Expense Reports, Purchase Requests, and Purchase Orders Quick Reference Guide</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Can I view transactions from different fiscal years in Integra?</h3>
    <p>No. Integra only allows users to view transactions from a single fiscal year at a time. The same is true for legal entities.</p>

    <h3 class="Heading3">What is the process for raising a PR in Integra at HQ?</h3>
    <p>The PR Creation process for HQ staff has the following two key components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each HQ department will have one or more focal points (PR Creators) who will be responsible for creating PRs and confirming receipt of goods or services (except engaging individual consultants) for their department.</li>
      <li>A centralized PO Creation Team, consisting of six members of the Nairobi-based GSC Master Data Management (MDM) Team has been established. This MDM team of PO Creators is responsible for creating and submitting the POs for approval and sending the POs to the vendors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style=" margin-left: 0.25in;">For more information, please see this Quick Reference Guide: <a href="http://s2.bl-1.com/h/cP2jw8Gs?url=https://rescue.box.com/s/968zsnjwjwqd88h4i3gmpevfdcyy8qwh">How do I know which Method of Procurement to use for the product(s) or service(s) I need?</a></p>
    <p>If you have been designated a PR Creator in your department, please see the <a href="https://rescue.box.com/s/05skmft5k5ndr7djnm57vbflwypj76kf">PR/PO FAQ</a> for more information on the centralized procurement process.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note</span>: For transactions requiring a PR/PO, any invoices submitted <span style="text-decoration:underline;">without </span>a PR/PO will be rejected by Accounts Payable (AP). The staff member will be notified to rectify before payment is made.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">What is the process for raising a PR in Integra in non-HQ locations?</h3>
    <p>For guidance on procurement in non-HQ locations, please visit the <a href="https://rescuenet.rescue.org/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=13015">RAI Training Page on RescueNet</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">If a PO becomes invalid during the course of a transaction, will the requestor be notified?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Requestors who wish to remove invalid POs from Integra should submit an <a href="https://nethope.service-now.com/navpage.do">Integra Help Request Form</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">What is the process for adding a vendor in Integra?</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">NYHQ</span>: Regardless of spend, programs and departments are required to <a href="http://s2.bl-1.com/h/cP2jwqhk?url=https://rescuenet.rescue.org/Interact/Pages/Section/Default.aspx?Section=3108">contact Supply Chain</a> when they wish to add or change Integra data or records associated with a vendor (excluding beneficiaries and employees), service, good or purchase agreement (i.e., master data). The Master Data Management (MDM) team in Nairobi will manage the creation of the vendor record in Integra.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CRRD and RAI</span>: If the annual anticipated spend is 2,500 USD or above, the office should <a href="http://s2.bl-1.com/h/cP2jwqhk?url=https://rescuenet.rescue.org/Interact/Pages/Section/Default.aspx?Section=3108">contact Supply Chain</a> and request that the vendor be created in Integra (see NYHQ process above). If the annual anticipated spend is less than 2,500 USD, authorized Supply Chain/Logistics staff in the office may create the vendor Integra, ensuring all necessary fields are populated and required supporting documentation is attached to the vendor record.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Please note</span> that if year-to-date transactions with a vendor exceed 2,500 USD, the vendor will automatically be placed on hold in Integra, meaning no new transactions with the vendor can take place until the vendor passes an ATC check.</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">If my department has a relationship with a vendor, do I still have to contact Supply Chain to create a vendor record?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Adding or changing data or records associated with a vendor is Supply Chain’s responsibility. (In CRRD and RAI offices, authorized Supply Chain/Logistics staff may create the vendor in Integra if the anticipated spend is less than 2,500 USD.)</p>
    <h3 class="Heading3">For petty cash payments, does a vendor need to be created in Integra?</h3>
    <p>No. If a payment counts as petty cash as per payment policy in the office, a vendor does not need to be created in Integra. (In cases where multiple petty cash payments are made for a specific vendor, offices are encouraged to create/define their own policy determining whether these vendors should be created in Integra.)</p>
