    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Key_Components_of_Inventory_Management"></a>Key Components of Inventory Management</h2>
    <p>The diagram below highlights the key areas that compose Inventory Management in Integra</p>
    <p><img alt="Picture 1" height="308.1" src="assets/images/CRRD UG_Inventory Management_QA_files/image1.png" width="623.6"/></p>
    <p>IRC uses both counting journals and inventory adjustments to make the proper adjustments to on-hand inventory. All inventory journals are posted by an authorized staff; in some instances this can be an in-office supply chain or warehouse manager.</p>
    <p>Physical Inventory Counts</p>
    <p>IRC has three different scheduled times where cycle counts are performed. These scenarios apply to CIK inventory as well.</p>
    <p>Periodic inventory count (20%count): 20% of products existing are randomly chosen for inventory counting every two months. Products chosen will not repeat within the same year. Last count may be more or less 20%, it will be “count everything that has not yet been counted.” CRRD does a 20% periodic count and as of April 2021 RAI does a periodic count every 6 months.</p>
    <p>Annual inventory count (100% count): A full inventory count is performed at the end of the fiscal year in the final days of September and warehouses are locked from 1-3 days depending on the country. All on-hand material is counted during an annual inventory count, including material procured for a grant/project and CIK/donated material.</p>
    <p>End of grant count (100% count): Two months before a grant ends, all remaining products procured for a grant that are counted. This applies to all purchased material.</p>
    <p>Note: A counting journal is also used to account for breakage, theft or loss of inventory.</p>
    <p>Inventory Adjustments</p>
    <p>Inventory adjustments are made upon discovery of discrepancies; not just when the annual cycle count is completed. Adjustments may be required for the following scenarios:</p>
    <p class="Numbering10 Numbering151">Disposal – Items are expired or damaged</p>
    <p class="Numbering10 Numbering151">Loss – It is discovered, while picking, that inventory is missing</p>
    <p class="Numbering10 Numbering151">Found – Material may be found and is added in to inventory</p>
    <p class="Numbering10 Numbering151">Item sampling – IRC receives samples of inventory from vendors in the RFP process. The IRC must keep the winning vendor’s samples for three years for audit purposes. Samples are recorded at zero cost and have no ledger impact</p>
    <p class="Numbering10 Numbering151">Sub-awardee inventory – Adjustment journals are used to track inventory given to sub-awardees and inventory procured by sub-awardees. This is recorded at zero cost and has no ledger impact.</p>
    <p class="Numbering10 Numbering151">IRC Dispensary inventory – IRC dispensaries can elect to track inventory in Integra and it is recorded at a zero cost with no ledger impact.</p>
    <p>If an inventory adjustment is substantial, there is the potential for an insurance claim to be made to help recoup the cost of the inventory loss/adjustment.</p>
    <p>All inventory journals such as adjustments and counting journals are posted by Supply Chain to a holding account. Supply Chain will attach proof for the adjustment, where applicable.</p>
    <p>Finance, in coordination with in-office Supply Chain or equivalent, executive director, etc., runs a report every two weeks to view all adjustment and counting journals. Finance evaluates the journals to account for any adjustments in inventory that will have a financial impact to the organization (i.e., spoilage uncovered during cycle count.) and will make financial adjustments as required.</p>

    <p><img alt="Picture 1" height="298.9" src="assets/images/CRRD UG_Inventory Management_QA_files/image2.png" width="637.8"/></p>
    <p class="Numbering1 Numbering131">Upon receipt of products, staff needs to manage the on-hand inventory.</p>
    <p class="Numbering1 Numbering131">All tasks are managed in Integra except for the physical inventory count. Once the physical count is complete, the counting journal is submitted and the results are recorded in Integra.</p>
    <p class="Numbering1 Numbering131">The physical count may be a segregated function from the recording and posting of the count results.<br/>

    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Create_Counting_Journal_–_Annual_Count"></a>Create <a class="tooltip" title=" "></a> – Annual Count</h2>
    <h3 class="Heading3">Purpose</h3>
    <p>Use this procedure to create a new counting journal for an annual inventory count in Integra. It is important to note that when a counting journal for an annual count is created, the journal locks the inventory in the system and you cannot pick/pack or add it to a different journal/transaction until the counting journal is complete and posted.</p>

    <h3 class="Heading3">Result</h3>
    <p>You have created an inventory counting journal for an end-of-grant count.</p>
    <p>The counting journal can now be printed in preparation to perform the actual count.</p>
    <p>To complete the process, refer to the previous procedures for:</p>

    <h3 class="Heading3">Purpose</h3>
    <p>Use this procedure to create a new counting journal for a 20% inventory count in Integra.</p>
    <p>This process is very similar to the counting journal process for the annual count but some of the criteria is changed for the 20%. This counting journal captures all the items in the warehouse in the 20% counting group to be counted and manually reduces the count to 20%.</p>
