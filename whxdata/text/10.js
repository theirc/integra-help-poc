All inventory journals are posted by an authorized staff; in some instances this can be an in-office supply chain or warehouse manager.","\n  ","Physical Inventory Counts","\n  ","IRC has three different scheduled times where cycle counts will be performed. These scenarios apply to CIK inventory as well.","\n  ","Periodic inventory count (20%count): 20% of products existing are randomly chosen for inventory counting every two months. Products chosen will not repeat within the same year. Last count may be more or less 20%, it will be “count everything that has not yet been counted.”","\n  ","Annual inventory count (100% count): A full inventory count is performed at the end of the year and warehouses are locked from 1-3 days depending on the country","\n  ","End of grant count (100% count): Two months before a grant ends, all remaining products procured for a grant that are counted.","\n  "],["\n  "],["\n  ","Inventory adjustments are made upon discovery of discrepancies; not just when the annual cycle count is completed. Adjustments may be required for the following scenarios:","\n  ","\n    ","Items are expired or damaged","\n    ","It is discovered, while picking, that inventory is missing","\n    ","If an inventory adjustment is substantial, there is the potential for an insurance claim to be made to help recoup the cost of the inventory loss/adjustment","\n    ","Supply Chain posts adjustments to a holding account","\n  ","\n  ","Finance, in coordination with in-office Supply Chain or equivalent, executive director, etc., account for any adjustments in inventory that will have a financial impact to the organization (i.e., spoilage uncovered during cycle count.)","\n  "],["\n  ","\n  ","Upon receipt of products, staff needs to manage the on-hand inventory.","\n  ","All tasks are managed in Integra except for the physical inventory count.","\n  ","The physical count may be a segregated function from the recording and posting of the count results.","\n  "],["\n  "],["\n  ","Use this procedure to create a new counting journal for an annual inventory count in Integra.","\n  "],["\n  ","Not applicable.","\n  "],["\n  ","\n    ","From the Integra home page, navigate modules to Inventory management >Journal entries ",">Item counting ",">Counting.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","Click New on the toolbar at the top of the page.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","Complete/select the following fields/buttons:","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","\n        ","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","\n            ","Field / Button","\n          ","\n          ","\n            ","Entry/Selection Required","\n          ","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","\n            ","Site","\n          ","\n          ","\n            ","Select the site from the drop-down selection list.","\n          ","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","\n            ","Warehouse","\n          ","\n          ","\n            ","Select the warehouse from the drop-down selection list.","\n          ","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","\n            ","Warehouse button","\n          ","\n          ","\n            ","Click button to change to Yes.","\n          ","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","\n            ","Location button","\n          ","\n          ","\n            ","Click button to change to Yes.","\n          ","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","\n            ","Project ID button","\n          ","\n          ","\n            ","Click button to change to Yes.","\n          ","\n        ","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","Click OK to proceed.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","On the toolbar at the top of page, click Create lines ",">On-hand.","\n    ","In the Create on-hand counting journal form, scroll down and expand the Records to include tab and click Filter.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","In the Items counting section, select the appropriate query then click OK.","\n    ","Review the results.
