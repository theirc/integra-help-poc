All inventory journals are posted by authorized staff; this can be in-office Supply Chain or a warehouse manager."," ","Note",": A counting journal is also used to account for breakage, theft, or loss of inventory."," ","Physical Inventory Counts"," ","IRC has three different scheduled times where cycle counts are performed. These scenarios apply to CIK inventory as well."," ","Periodic inventory count ","(20% count): 20% of products existing are randomly chosen for inventory counting every two months. Products chosen will not repeat within the same year. Last count may be more or less 20%, it will be “count everything that has not yet been counted.” CRRD does a 20% periodic count and as of April 2021 RAI does a periodic count every 6 months."," ","Annual inventory count ","(100% count): A full inventory count is performed at the end of the fiscal year in the final days of September and warehouses are locked from 1-3 days depending on the country. All on-hand material is counted during an annual inventory count, including material procured for a grant/project and CIK/donated material."," ","End of grant count"," (100% count): Two months before a grant ends, all remaining products procured for a grant that are counted. This applies to all purchased material."," ","Note",": A counting journal is also used to account for breakage, theft, or loss of inventory."," ","Inventory Adjustments"," ","Inventory adjustments are made upon discovery of discrepancies; not just when the annual cycle count is completed. Adjustments may be required for the following scenarios:"," ","Disposal"," – Items are expired or damaged"," ","Loss"," – It is discovered, while picking, that inventory is missing"," ","Found"," – Material may be found and is added in to inventory"," ","Item sampling"," – IRC receives samples of inventory from vendors in the RFP process. The IRC must keep the winning vendor’s samples for three years for audit purposes. Samples are recorded at zero cost and have no ledger impact"," ","If an inventory adjustment is substantial, there is the potential for an insurance claim to be made to help recoup the cost of the inventory loss/adjustment."," ","All inventory journals such as adjustments and counting journals are posted by Supply Chain to a holding account. Supply Chain will attach proof for the adjustment, where applicable."," ","Finance, in coordination with in-office Supply Chain or equivalent, executive director, etc., runs a report every two weeks to view all adjustment and counting journals. Finance evaluates the journals to account for any adjustments in inventory that will have a financial impact to the organization (i.e., spoilage uncovered during cycle count.) and will make financial adjustments as required."],[" ","Upon receipt of products, staff need to manage the on-hand inventory."," ","All tasks are managed in Integra except for the ","inventory count.
