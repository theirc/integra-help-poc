Some examples are, ","All purchase orders"," grid, ","Vouchers"," grid, ","All projects"," grid. There are default grid layouts automatically applied by the Integra system but often these default layouts contain columns that are not applicable to a user or they may be missing columns that would be valuable for a user. As such, the system allows a user to customize the grid layout to suit their personal needs.
